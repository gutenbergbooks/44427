<h2>
INTRODUCTION.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong the illustrious names which adorn the annals of France, that of
François Auguste de Chateaubriand, the author of &ldquo;Atala,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Martyrs,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;The Last of the Abencerages,&rdquo; and many other brilliant and renowned
works, occupies a proud pre-eminence. But his fame rests not merely upon
his literary achievements. His services as a statesman and the record and
example of his private life-even his sufferings and misfortunes-have
served to enhance his reputation and endear his memory, both among his own
countrymen, and among just, noble and patriotic minds in other lands. He
was great both by his character and abilities; and, while his celebrity is
undiminished by the lapse of time, his works are still read and will long
continue to be read and admired, even through all changes in the manners
and sentiments of mankind. Fashions and modes in literature and art, as in
society, come and go; new institutions arise, demanding new methods and
modifying cherished customs; and men&rsquo;s thoughts enlarge and widen with
improved conditions, as with the inevitable progress of the age. But the
master mind ever asserts its power. He who has once truly stirred the
human heart in its purest depths speaks not alone to his own generation,
but appeals to all other hearts and belongs to all his race. His good
gifts are the birthright of the world. The rank of Chateaubriand has been
fixed by the united judgment of his associates and his successors; and
since time has allayed the fierce passions which raged in France during
his lifetime, his character is more and more deeply respected and admired.
His sincerity of purpose and enlightened understanding, his grandeur and
nobility of thought, his energy of action and loftiness of aim, preserve
for him ever his exalted position, made brilliant by the fires of genius
and perpetuated by the force of truth.
</p>
<p>
Chateaubriand was born at St. Malo in September, 1768, and died in Paris,
after an active and most eventful career, on the fourth of July, 1848. The
earlier portion of his life was passed in the quiet of his home at
Combourg. At the termination of his collegiate training at Dole and
Rennes, he entered the army, in which he soon gained promotion. At about
the age of nineteen he was presented at court, became acquainted with the
fashionable world, and was received and welcomed into the choicest
literary circles of Paris, where he gained the friendship of La Harpe,
Fontanes, Malesherbes, and others among the distinguished savants of that
period. It was a troubled and stormy epoch in France. The social and
political forces which culminated in the great Revolution were beginning
to be seriously felt, and faction, turbulence and anarchy were already
rife in Paris when Chateaubriand left his native shores for America, moved
by a desire to discover the northwest passage, but also with an attendant
purpose, long cherished, of observing the mode of life and studying the
characteristics of the aborigines, for the purpose of embodying in his
writings the impressions thus gained of man in a primitive condition.
</p>
<p>
From this period to the time of his death his life was a singular series
of vicissitudes&mdash;at one time the brilliant and revered statesman, at
another the voluntary abdicator of all his rights and honors; and even, at
one bitter passage of his existence, living in an unwarmed London garret
and obtaining a precarious livelihood by giving lessons in his native
tongue and translating for the booksellers.
</p>
<p>
The utter upheaval of affairs in France brought the greatest distress upon
himself, his family and his immediate friends, and, with the sensitive
heart of genius, the blows which had fallen so keenly doubtless engendered
the melancholy cast with which his writings are sometimes tinged. His
first work, an idyllic poem, showed little of the genius so finely
developed in after years; but his finest literary productions&mdash;&ldquo;The
Martyrs,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last of the Abencerages&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Genius of Christianity,&rdquo;
 to which &ldquo;Atala&rdquo; and &ldquo;René&rdquo; properly belong&mdash;remain a splendid
monument to his powers and exhibit his earnest desire to be numbered among
the benefactors and enlighteners of mankind.
</p>
<p>
The present work, &ldquo;Atala,&rdquo; is the gathered fruit of his previous studies
amid the wilds of America. It abounds in sparkling description, romantic
incident and sentiments tender and heroic. It is pervaded by purity of
tone and elevation of thought, qualities the more commendable and marked
because produced in an age proverbially lax and frivolous.
</p>
<p>
The illustrations of M. Doré have given an additional value to this tale,
so simple, so unsophisticated, yet blooming with all the wild luxuriance
of nature. The artist has added his gifts to those of the poet; and those
acquainted only with his ready and original powers as the delineator of
farce and drollery, or of the exceptionally tragic and horrible, will find
new cause for admiration in these quiet renderings of the primeval
beauties of the American wild&mdash;its plains and forests, its still
lagoons and roaring cataracts, its mountain slopes and deep defiles&mdash;all
its aspects of rudest workmanship&mdash;and will welcome these efforts of
his genius in the lovely realm of descriptive art, wedded as they are to
the exquisite simplicity of this Indian romance. As in his other works,
here may be noted the same surpassing fertility of resource, the same
alertness of intellect and readiness and swiftness of touch; but there may
also be found new proofs of his complete sympathy with all that is
picturesque in forest beauty and his high intuitive perception of every
possible phase of nature in her wildest caprice and most tender bloom.
</p>
<p>
We append the following extracts from different prefaces to the author&rsquo;s
writings, as constituting what is explanatory of the story that follows:
</p>
<p>
[From the Preface to the First Edition.]
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was still very young when I conceived the idea of composing an epic on
‘The Man of Nature,&rsquo; to depict the manners of savages, by uniting them
with some well-known event. After the discovery of America, I saw no
subject more interesting, especially to Frenchmen, than the massacre of
the Natchez colony in Louisiana, in 1727. All the Indian tribes
conspiring, after two centuries of oppression, for the restoration of
liberty to the New World, appeared to me to offer a subject almost as
attractive as the conquest of Mexico. I put some fragments of the work to
paper; but I soon found that I was weak in local coloring, and that, if I
wished to produce a picture of real resemblance, it became necessary for
me, in imitation of Homer&rsquo;s example, to visit the tribes I was desirous of
describing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In 1789 I made M. de Malesherbes acquainted with my idea of going to
America; but, wishing at the same time to give a useful object to my
voyage, I formed the project of discovering the overland passage so long
sought after, and concerning which even Captain Cook himself had left some
doubts. I started, visited the American solitudes, and returned with plans
for a second voyage, which was to last nine years. I proposed to traverse
the entire continent of North America, afterwards to explore the coasts to
the north of California, and to return by Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, rounding the pole.
M. de Malesherbes undertook to submit my plans to the Government, and it
was then that he listened to the first fragments of the little work I now
offer to the public. The Revolution put a stop to all my projects. Covered
with the blood of my only brother, of my sister-in-law, and of the
illustrious old man, their father; having seen my mother and another
talented sister die in consequence of the treatment they had undergone in
prison, I wandered forth to foreign lands, where the only friend I had
preserved stabbed himself in my arms.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of all my manuscripts upon America, I have only saved some fragments,
‘Atala&rsquo; in particular, which was itself but an episode of &lsquo;The Natchez.&rsquo; 
‘Atala&rsquo; was written in the desert, beneath the huts of the savages. I do
not know whether the public will like the story, which quits all beaten
tracks, and represents a nature and manners altogether foreign to Europe.
There is no adventure in &lsquo;Atala.&rsquo; It is a sort of poem, half descriptive,
half dramatic. It consists entirely in the portraiture of two lovers
walking and talking together in the solitudes, and in the picture of the
trials of love in the midst of the calm of the desert. I have endeavored
to give to this work the most antique forms. It is divided into Prologue,
Recital and Epilogue. The principal parts of the story have each a
denomination, such as &lsquo;The Hunters,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Laborers,&rsquo; etc.; and it was thus
that, in the early ages of Greece, the rhapsodists sang, under different
titles, fragments of the &lsquo;Iliad&rsquo; and &lsquo;Odyssey.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The moralities I have been desirous of inculcating in &lsquo;Atala&rsquo; are easily
discoverable, and as they are summed up in the Epilogue, I need not speak
of them here. I will merely say a word or two concerning Chactas, the
lover of Atala.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is a savage more than half civilized, since he knows not only the
living, but also the dead languages of Europe. He can therefore express
himself in a mixed style, suitable to the line upon which he stands,
between society and nature. This circumstance has given me some
advantages, by permitting Chactas to speak as a savage in the description
of manners, and as a European in the dramatic portions of the narrative.
Without that the work must have been abandoned. If I had always made use
of the Indian style, &lsquo;Atala&rsquo; would have been Hebrew for the reader.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to the missionary, he is a simple priest, who speaks without blushing
of the Cross, of the blood of his Divine Master, of the corrupted flesh,
etc.; in one word, he is really a priest. I am aware that it is difficult
to depict such a character without awakening ideas of ridicule in the
minds of certain readers. Where I do not draw a tear, I may raise a smile;
that must depend upon individual sentiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must say a last word as to &lsquo;Atala.&rsquo; The subject is not entirely of my
invention. It is certain that there was a savage at the galleys and at the
court of Louis XIV.; it is certain that a French missionary accomplished
the facts I have related; it is certain that I saw savages in the American
forests carrying away the bones of their forefathers, and a young mother
exposing the body of her child upon the branches of a tree. Some other
circumstances narrated are also veritable, but as they are not of general
interest, it is needless for me to speak of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
[From the Preface to &ldquo;Alain&rdquo; and &ldquo;René&rdquo; published in 1805. ]
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been stopped in the corrections neither by the consideration of
the cost of the book, nor by that of the length of the work. A few years
have sufficed to make me acquainted with the weak or defective portions of
that episode. Obedient upon this point to the critics, even so far as to
reproach myself with an excess of docility, I have proved to those who
attacked me that I never remain voluntarily in error, and that, at all
times and upon all subjects, I am ready to give way to lights superior to
my own. &lsquo;Atala&rsquo; has been reprinted eleven times&mdash;five times
separately and six times in the &lsquo;Genius of Christianity.&rsquo; If those eleven
editions were compared, scarcely two would be found to be altogether
alike.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The twelfth, which I now publish, has been revised with the greatest
care. I have consulted the friends prompt to censure me; I have weighed
each phrase, examined every word. The style, freed from certain epithets
which embarrassed it, proceeds perhaps more naturally and with greater
simplicity. I have introduced more order and logic into certain ideas, and
I have effaced even the slightest inaccuracies of language. M. de la Harpe
observed to me, on the subject of &lsquo;Atala,&rsquo; &lsquo;If you will shut yourself up
with me only for a few hours, that time will suffice for wiping out the
spots that cause your critics to cry out so loudly.&rsquo; I have passed four
years in the revision of this episode; but it is now as I intend it to
remain. It is at present the only &lsquo;Atala&rsquo; I shall ever in future
acknowledge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The new nature and the new manners I have described have also drawn upon
me another ill-considered reproach. I have been taken for the inventor of
certain extraordinary details, whereas I merely repeated circumstances
well known to all travellers. Some notes added to the present edition of
‘Atala&rsquo; would easily have justified this assertion; but if I had
introduced them at every point where each reader might have looked for
them, they would soon have exceeded the length of the work itself. I
therefore gave up the idea of annotations.&rdquo;

<h2>
PROLOGUE
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rance formerly possessed in North America a vast empire, extending from
Labrador to the Floridas, and from the shores of the Atlantic to the most
distant lakes of Upper Canada.
</p>
<p>
Four great rivers, deriving their sources from the same mountains, divided
these immense regions: the river St. Lawrence, which is lost to the east
in the gulf of that name; the Western River, whose waters flow on to seas
unknown; the river Bourbon, which runs from south to north into Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay; and the Mississippi, whose waters fall from north to south into the
Gulf of Mexico.
</p>
<p>
The last-named river, in its course of more than a thousand leagues,
waters a delicious country, called by the inhabitants of the United States
the New Eden, to which the French left the pretty appellation of
Louisiana. A thousand other rivers, tributaries of the Mississippi&mdash;the
Missouri, the Illinois, the Arkansas, the Wabache, the Tennessee&mdash;enrich
it with their mud and fertilize it with their waters. When all these
rivers have been swollen by the deluges of winter, uprooted trees, forming
large portions of forests torn down by tempests, crowd about their
sources. In a short time the mud cements the torn trees together, and they
become enchained by creepers, which, taking root in every direction, bind
and consolidate the débris. Carried away by the foaming waves, the rafts
descend to the Mississippi, which, taking possession of them, hurries them
down towards the Gulf of Mexico, throws them upon sandbanks, and so
increases the number of its mouths. At intervals the swollen river raises
its voice whilst passing over the resisting heaps, and spreads its
overflowing waters around the colonnades of the forests, and the pyramids
of the Indian tombs: and so the Mississippi is the Nile of these deserts.
But grace is always united to splendor in the scenes of Nature: while the
mid-stream bears away towards the sea the dead trunks of pine-trees and
oaks, the lateral currents on either side convey along the shores floating
islands of pistias and nenuphars, whose yellow roses stand out like little
pavilions. Green serpents, blue herons, pink flamingoes, and baby
crocodiles embark as passengers on these rafts of flowers; and the
brilliant colony, unfolding to the wind its golden sails, glides along
slumberingly till it arrives at some retired creek in the river.
</p>
<p>
The two shores of the Mississippi present the most extraordinary picture.
On the western border vast savannahs spread away farther than the eye can
reach, and their waves of verdure, as they recede, appear to rise
gradually into the azure sky, where they fade away. In these limitless
meadows herds of three or four thousand wild buffaloes wander at random.
Sometimes, cleaving the waters as it swims, a bison, laden with years,
comes to repose among the high grass on an island of the Mississippi, its
forehead ornamented with two crescents, and its ancient and slimy beard
giving it the appearance of a god of the river throwing an eye of
satisfaction upon the grandeur of its waters, and the wild abundance of
its shores.
</p>

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/013.jpg"><i>FULL-SIZE</i></a> -- <a href="images/013m.jpg"><i>Medium-Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Such is the scene upon the western border; but it changes on the opposite
side, which forms an admirable contrast with the other shore. Suspended
along the course of the waters, grouped upon the rocks and upon the
mountains, and dispersed in the valleys, trees of every form, of every
color, and of every perfume, throng and grow together, stretching up into
the air to heights that weary the eye to follow. Wild vines, bignonias,
coloquintidas, intertwine each other at the feet of these trees, escalade
their trunks, and creep along to the extremity of their branches,
stretching from the maple to the tulip-tree, from the tulip-tree to the
holly-hock, and thus forming thousands of grottoes, arches and porticoes.
Often, in their wanderings from tree to tree, these creepers cross the arm
of a river, over which they throw a bridge of flowers. Out of the midst of
these masses, the magnolia, raising its motionless cone, surmounted by
large white buds, commands all the forest, where it has no other rival
than the palm-tree, which gently waves, close by, its fans of verdure.
</p>
<p>
A multitude of animals, placed in these retreats by the hand of the
Creator, spread about life and enchantment. From the extremities of the
avenues may be seen bears, intoxicated with the grape, staggering upon the
branches of the elm-trees; cariboos bathe in the lake; black-squirrels
play among the thick foliage; mocking-birds, and Virginian pigeons not
bigger than sparrows, fly down upon the turf, reddened with strawberries;
green parrots with yellow heads, purple woodpeckers, cardinals red as
fire, clamber up to the very tops of the cypress-trees; humming-birds
sparkle upon the jessamine of the Floridas; and bird-catching serpents
hiss while suspended to the domes of the woods, where they swing about
like the creepers themselves.
</p>
<p>
If all is silence and repose in the savannahs on the other side of the
river, all here, on the contrary, is sound and motion; peckings against
the trunks of the oaks, frictions of animals walking along as they nibble
or crush between their teeth the stones of fruits, the roaring of the
waves, plaintive cries, dull bellowings and mild cooings, fill these
deserts with a tender yet wild harmony. But when a breeze happens to
animate these solitudes, to swing these floating bodies, to confound these
masses of white, blue, green, and pink, to mix all the colors and to
combine all the murmurs, there issue such sounds from the depths of the
forests, and such things pass before the eyes, that I should in vain
endeavor to describe them to those who have never visited these primitive
fields of Nature.
</p>
<p>
After the discovery of the Mississippi by Father Marquette and the
unfortunate La Salle, the first Frenchmen who established themselves at
Biloxi and at New Orleans entered into an alliance with the Natchez, an
Indian nation whose power was redoubtable in those countries. Quarrels and
jealousies subsequently ensanguined the land of hospitality. Amongst these
savages there was an old man named Chactas, * who, on account of his age,
wisdom and knowledge of the affairs of life, was the patriarch and the
beloved of the deserts. Like many other men, he had acquired virtue by
calamity. Not only were the forests of the New World filled with his
misfortunes, but he bore the tale of his calamities even to the shores of
France. Kept at the galleys at Marseilles by a cruel act of injustice,
restored to liberty, and presented to Louis XIV., he had conversed with
the great men of that age, and had been present at the fêtes of
Versailles, at the tragedies of Racine, and at the funeral orations of
Bossuet: in one word, the savage had contemplated society at the moment of
its greatest splendor.
</p>
<p>
For several years Chactas, restored to the bosom of his country, had been
in the enjoyment of repose. Nevertheless, Providence granted him even this
favor dearly: the old man had become blind. A young girl used to accompany
him on the hills of the Mississippi, just as Antigone formerly guided the
steps of Odipus over the Cithæron, or as Malvina conducted Ossian over the
rocks of Morven.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the numerous acts of injustice to which Chactas had been
subjected by the French, he was very partial to them. He ever remembered
Fénélon, whose guest he had been, and desired an opportunity for rendering
service to the fellow-countrymen of that virtuous man. A favorable
occasion presented itself. In 1725 a Frenchman named René, driven thither
by his passions and his misfortunes, arrived at Louisiana. He ascended the
Mississippi as far as the territory of the Natchez, and asked to be
accepted as a warrior of that nation. Chactas, having questioned him, and
finding him not to be shaken in his resolution, adopted him as a son, and
united him to an Indian girl called Céluta. Shortly after this marriage
the savages prepared to go beaver-hunting.
</p>
<p>
On account of the respect with which the Indian tribes regarded the old
man, Chactas, although blind, was appointed by the council of the wise men
to command the expedition. Prayers and fasts commenced, the jugglers
interpreted the dreams, the manitous were consulted, sacrifices of tobacco
were offered up, fillets of elk-tongues were burnt, the assistants
examining whether they sputtered in the flames, in order to ascertain the
will of the genii; and at length they started, after having partaken of
the sacred dog. René was of the party.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The harmonious voice.
</pre>
<p>
With the assistance of the counter-currents, the pirogues reascended the
Mississippi, and reached the bed of the Ohio. One moonlight night, while
all the Natchez were asleep at the bottom of their pirogues, and the
Indian fleet, under a crowd of beast-skin sails, was flying before a mild
breeze, René, who had remained alone with Chactas, asked him to tell the
story of his adventures. The old man consented to satisfy his curiosity,
and began in these words:&mdash;

<h2>
I. THE HUNTERS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he destiny which has brought us together, my dear son, is a singular
one. I see in you the civilized man become savage: you see in me the wild
man whom the Great Spirit (I know not from what motive) desired to
civilize. Having each entered upon the career of life from opposite
directions, you came to repose yourself at my place, and I have seated
myself in yours; so that we must have acquired a totally different view of
things. Which of the twain has gained or lost the more by this change of
position? That is known to the genii, the least learned of whom possesses
more wisdom than all mankind together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the next flower-moon * there will be seven times ten snows, and three
snows more, since my mother brought me into the world on the banks of the
Mississippi. The Spaniards had recently established themselves in the Bay
of Pensacola, but no European yet inhabited Louisiana. I had scarcely
witnessed seventeen falls of the leaves when I marched with my father, the
warrior Outalissi, against the Muscogulges, a powerful nation in the
Floridas. We united our forces with those of the Spaniards, our allies,
and the combat took place upon one of the branches of the Mobile. Areskoui
* and the manitous were not favorable to us. Our enemies triumphed: my
father lost his life; I was twice wounded whilst defending him. O why did
I not then go down into the land of souls! I should have avoided the
misfortunes which were awaiting me on earth. The Spirits ordained
otherwise. I was dragged along by the defeated crowd to Saint Augustine.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The month of Way.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;In that city, but then recently built by the Spaniards, I ran the risk of
being carried away to the mines of Mexico, when an old Castilian, named
Lopez, touched by my youth and simplicity, offered me an asylum, and
presented me to his sister, with whom he was living spouseless.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Both of them took to me in the tenderest manner. I was brought up with
much care, and had all sorts of masters given to me. But after having
passed thirty moons at Saint Augustine, I was afflicted with a disgust for
the life of cities. I fell away visibly: sometimes I remained motionless
for hours whilst contemplating the summits of distant forests; at other
times I might be seen seated on the banks of a river, gazing sadly upon
the flowing waters. I figured to myself the woods through which those
waters had passed, and my soul was thus entirely given up to solitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No longer able to resist the desire of returning to the desert, I one
morning presented myself to Lopez dressed in my savage attire, holding in
one hand my bow and arrows, and in the other my European costume, which I
returned to my generous protector, at whose feet I fell, shedding a
torrent of tears, giving myself odious names, and accusing myself of
ingratitude. &lsquo;After all, O my father,&rsquo; said I to him, &lsquo;you see it
yourself; I must die if I do not resume the life of the Indian.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lopez, struck with astonishment, endeavored to change my determination.
He spoke of the dangers I was about to encounter, by exposing myself to
the possibility of falling into the hands of the Muscogulges. But
perceiving at last that I was resolved to risk everything, he melted into
tears, and, pressing me in his arms with affection, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;child
of Nature; take back this independence of man, of which Lopez does not
wish to deprive you. If I were myself younger, I would accompany you to
the desert (where I also have sweet remembrances), and restore you to your
mother&rsquo;s arms. When you shall be once again in your forests, think
sometimes of the old Spaniard who gave you hospitality, and remember, in
order that you may be disposed to love your fellow-creatures, that your
first experience of the human heart was altogether in its favor.&rsquo; Lopez
finished by a prayer to the God of the Christians, whose religion I had
refused to embrace, and we separated with much sadness.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The god of war.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;It was not long before I was punished for my ingratitude. My inexperience
caused me to lose myself in the wood, and I was taken by a party of
Muscogulges and Seminoles, as Lopez had predicted. My dress, and the
feathers ornamenting my head, caused me to be recognized as a Natchez.

I was enchained, but slightly, on account of my youth. Simaghan, the
leader of the troop, desired to learn my name. I replied, &lsquo;I am called
Chactas, son of Outalissi, son of Miscou, who have taken more than a
hundred scalps from the heroes of the Muscogulges.&rsquo; Simaghan then said,
‘Chactas, son of Outalissi, son of Miscou, rejoice; thou shalt be burnt at
the big village.&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; and began to chaunt the song
of death.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Although a prisoner, I could not refrain, during the first few days, from
admiring my enemies. The Muscogulge, and especially his ally, the
Seminole, is full of gaiety, love and contentment. His walk is light, his
mien calm and open. He speaks much, and with volubility. His language is
harmonious and flowing. Even age does not deprive the sachems of this
joyous simplicity: like the old birds of our forests, they mingle their
ancient songs with the fresh notes of their young posterity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The women who accompanied the troop displayed for my youth a tender pity
and an amiable curiosity. They questioned me about my mother, concerning
the earliest days of my life; and they wanted to know whether my cradle of
moss had been hung upon the flowering branches of the maple-trees, and
whether the breezes had rocked me near the nests of the little birds. Then
came a thousand other questions as to the state of my heart. They asked me
if I had seen a white fawn in my dreams, and whether the trees of the
secret valley had advised me to love. I replied with simplicity to the
mothers, to the daughters, and to the spouses of the men, saying, &lsquo;You are
the graces of the day, and the night loves you like dew. Man issues from
your loins to hang upon your breast and upon your lips: you know the magic
words that lull every pain. So was I told by her who brought me into the
world, and who will never see me again! She told me also that maidens are
mysterious flowers met with in solitary places.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These praises gave much pleasure to the women, who overwhelmed me with
all sorts of presents, and brought me cocoa-nut cream, maple-tree sugar,
saganrite, * bear-hams, beaver-skins, shells with which to ornament
myself, and moss for my couch. They sang and laughed with me, and then
took to shedding tears at the thought that I was to be burnt.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* A description of cake made with Indian corn.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;One night, when the Muscogulges had pitched their camp on the outskirt of
a forest, I was seated near the war-fire with the guard who had charge of
me. All of a sudden, I heard the sound of a dress upon the grass, and a
female, half-veiled, came and sat down by my side. Tears were rolling from
beneath her eyelids, and I saw by the light of the fire that a small
golden crucifix shone upon her bosom. She was altogether beautiful, and I
remarked upon her countenance an expression of virtue and passion of
irresistible attraction. To that she added the most tender graces: an
extreme sensitiveness, united to a profound melancholy, breathed in her
looks, and her smile was heavenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I took her to be the Virgin of the last Loves, the virgin sent to the
prisoner of war to enchant his tomb. Under this impression, I said to her
stammeringly, and with an emotion that did not, however, proceed from any
feeling of fear of the funeral pile, &lsquo;O virgin, you are worthy of a first
love, and you are not made for the last. The palpitations of a heart that
will soon cease to beat would ill respond to the movements of your own.
How can death and life lie mingled together? You would cause me to regret
too much the approach of day. Let another be happier than myself, and may
long embraces unite the tender plant to the oak!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The youthful maiden then said to me, &lsquo;I am not the Virgin of the last
Loves. Are you a Christian?&rsquo; I replied that I had not betrayed the genii
of my cottage. At these words the Indian made an involuntary movement, and
said, &lsquo;I pity you for being merely a wicked idolator. My mother made me a
Christian; my name is Atala, and I am the daughter of Simaghan of the
Golden Bracelets, the chief of the warriors of this troop. We are going to
Apalachucla, where you will be burnt.&rsquo; Having uttered these words, Atala
rose and took her departure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here. Chactas was compelled to interrupt his story. A crowd of souvenirs
rushed into his soul; his closed eyes inundated his furrowed cheeks with
tears, just as two springs, hidden in the profound depths of the earth,
reveal themselves by the waters they send filtering between the rocks.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my son,&rdquo; said he, after a long pause, &ldquo;you perceive that Chactas is
not very wise, notwithstanding his reputation for wisdom. Alas! my dear
child, although men can no longer see, they can still weep! Several days
passed. Every evening the old man&rsquo;s daughter came to converse with me.
Sleep had fled from my eyes, and Atala was in my heart like the
remembrance of the resting-place of my fathers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the seventeenth day of our march, about the time when the ephemeran
rises from the waters, we entered upon the grand savannah of Alachua. The
plain is surrounded with hills, which, receding behind one another, are
covered, as they appear to touch the clouds, with ranges of forests of
palm-trees, citron-trees, magnolias and oaks. The chief uttered the cry of
arrival, and the troop encamped at the foot of a hill-side. I was left at
some distance, on the border of one of those natural wells so famous in
the Floridas, attached to the trunk of a tree, and guarded by a warrior
who watched me with impatience. I had passed but some moments in this
place when Atala appeared beneath the liquid ambers of the fountain.
‘Hunter,&rsquo; said she to the Muscogulgan hero, &lsquo;if you would like to chase
the stag, I will guard the prisoner.&rsquo; The warrior jumped for joy at this
offer of the chiefs daughter, and at once hurried from the top of the
hill, and directed his steps towards the plain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a strange contradiction is the heart of man! I, who had so much
desired to speak of things mysterious to her whom I already loved like the
sun, suddenly became troubled and confused, and felt as though I should
have preferred to be thrown amongst the crocodiles in the fountain to
finding myself alone with Atala. The daughter of the desert was as much
affected as her prisoner. We observed a profound silence; for the genii of
love had deprived us of speech. After an interval, Atala, making an
effort, spoke thus: &lsquo;Warrior, you are held but slightly: you can easily
escape.&rsquo; At these words courage returned to my tongue, and I replied, &lsquo;But
slightly held, O woman!&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash; I could not complete my phrase.
Atala hesitated some moments, and then said, &lsquo;Fly!&rsquo; at the same time
liberating me from the trunk of the tree. I seized the cord, and returned
it to the hand of the foreign maiden, forcing her beautiful fingers to
close themselves upon my chain. &lsquo;Take it back! Take it back!&rsquo; I cried.
‘You are mad!&rsquo; said Atala, in a voice full of emotion. &lsquo;Wretched man, do
you not know that you will be burnt? What do you mean? Do you reflect that
I am the daughter of a redoubtable sachem?&rsquo; &lsquo;There was a time,&rsquo; I replied,
with tears, &lsquo;when I also was carried about in a beaver-skin on the
shoulders of a mother: my father also had a fine cottage, and his fawns
drank of the waters of a thousand torrents; but I now wander without a
country. When I shall have ceased to exist, no friend will place a little
grass over my body, to keep the insects away from it. The corpse of an
unhappy stranger interests no one.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These words touched Atala. Her tears fell into the fountain. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; I
continued with vivacity, &lsquo;if your heart spoke like mine! Is not the desert
free? Do not the forests contain folds in which we could conceal
ourselves? And, in order to be happy, are there so many things necessary
for the children of the huts? O maiden, more beautiful than the first
dream of a spouse! O my well-beloved, dare to follow me!&rsquo; Such was my
language. Atala replied to me in a tender tone of voice, &lsquo;My young friend,
you have learnt the expressions of the white men; it is easy to deceive an
Indian girl!&rsquo; &lsquo;What!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;you call me your young friend. Ah, if
a poor slave&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, leaning upon me, &lsquo;a poor
slave&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
I continued with ardor, &lsquo;Let a kiss assure him of your faith!&rsquo; Atala
listened to my prayers. As a fawn appears to cling to the flowers of the
rosy creepers which it seizes with its delicate tongue on the
mountain-steeps, so I remained attached to the lips of my well-beloved.

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, my dear son, pain is in close attendance upon pleasure. Who could
have thought that the moment in which Atala gave me the first token of her
love should be precisely that in which she would destroy all my hopes?
White hairs of old Chactas, what was your astonishment when the daughter
of the sachem pronounced these words: &lsquo;Beautiful prisoner, I have
foolishly given way to your desire; but whither will this passion lead us?
My religion separates me from you for ever&mdash;&mdash;. Oh, my mother,
what hast thou done?&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash; Atala became suddenly silent, and kept
back I know not what fatal secret about to escape from her lips. Her words
plunged me into despair. &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;I will be as cruel as
you; I will not escape. You shall see me in the flame of fire; you shall
hear the groans of my flesh, and you will be full of joy.&rsquo; Atala took my
hands between both of hers. &lsquo;Poor young idolator,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I really
grieve for you! You wish me, then, to weep my whole heart out? What a pity
I cannot fly with you! Unhappy was the bosom of thy mother, O Atala! Why
dost thou not throw thyself to the crocodiles in the fountain?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That very moment the crocodiles, at the approach of the setting of the
sun, began to make their cries heard. Atala said to me, &lsquo;Let us leave this
place.&rsquo; I led away the daughter of Simaghan to the foot of the hills,
which form gulfs of verdure by advancing their promontories into the
savannahs. Everything in the desert was splendidly imposing. The stork was
screaming upon its nest; the woods resounded with the monotonous song of
the quails, the whistling of the paraquets, the lowing of the bisons and
the neighing of the Siminolian cavalry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Our promenade was almost a dumb one. I walked by the side of Atala, who
was holding the end of the cord which I had forced her to take back again.
Sometimes we shed tears, and sometimes we endeavored to smile. A look, now
directed towards the sky and then towards the earth; an ear listening to
the song of the birds; a gesture towards the setting sun; a hand tenderly
pressed; a bosom by turns palpitating and tranquil: the names of Chactas
and Atala softly repeated at intervals! Oh, first promenade of love, thy
souvenir must be extremely powerful, since after so many years of
misfortune it can still stir the heart of old Chactas!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How incomprehensible are mortals when agitated by the passions! I had
just abandoned the generous-hearted Lopez; I had just exposed myself to
every danger for the sake of liberty, and in one instant the look of a
woman had changed my tastes, my resolutions, my thoughts! Forgetful of my
country, my mother, my cabin, and the frightful death awaiting me, I had
become indifferent to everything that was not Atala. Lacking strength to
raise myself to the reason of a man, I had suddenly fallen into a sort of
childishness, and, far from being able to do anything to extricate myself
from threatening misfortunes, I almost required some one to provide me
with the means of sleep and nourishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was therefore in vain that Atala, after our ramble in the savannah,
threw herself at my knees and again begged me to leave her. I declared
that I would return alone to the camp, if she refused to re-attach me to
the trunk of my tree. She was compelled to comply with my request, hoping
to convince me another time.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The next day, which decided the fate of my life, we halted in a valley
not far from Cuscowilla, the capital of the Seminoles. These Indians,
together with the Muscogulges, form the confederation of the Creeks. The
daughter of the land of palm-trees came to find me in the middle of the
night. She conducted me to a great pine-forest, and renewed her entreaties
to induce me to escape. Without replying to her, I took her hand in mine,
and forced the thirsting fawn to wander with me into the forest. The night
was delicious. The genius of the air appeared to be shaking the blue
canopy, embalmed with the odor of the pines; and we breathed a slight
perfume of amber emitted by the crocodiles asleep beneath the
tamarind-trees by the river-side. The moon was shining in the midst of a
spotless azure, and the pearl-grey light fell upon the undefined summit of
the forests. Not a sound was to be heard, except I know not what distant
harmony that reigned in the depth of the woods. It seemed as though the
soul of solitude was sighing throughout the entire extent of the desert.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Through the trees we perceived a young man, who, holding a torch in his
hand, looked like the genius of spring visiting the forests to reanimate
Nature. He was a lover on his way to learn his fate at the cabin of his
mistress.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Should the maiden blow out the torch, she accepts the offered vows; but
if she veil herself without extinguishing it, she refuses the spouse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The warrior, gliding through the shades, chanted these words in a low
tone of voice:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I will outrun the steps of the daylight upon the mountain-tops to seek
my lonely dove in the midst of the oaks of the forest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I have fastened around her throat a necklace of porcelain, * with three
red beads for my love, three violet ones for my fears, three blue ones for
my hopes.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* A necklace of shells.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mila has the eyes of an ermine, and hair as light as a field of rice;
her mouth is a pink shell lined with pearls; her two breasts are like two
little spotless kids, born the same day of one mother.

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;May Mila extinguish this torch! May her mouth cast a voluptuous shade
over it! I will fertilize her bosom! The hope of the country shall hang
from her fruitful breast, and I will smoke my calumet of peace by the
cradle of my son.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! let me outrun the steps of the daylight upon the mountain-tops to
seek my lonely dove amidst the oaks of the forest!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thus sang this young man, whose accents agitated me to the bottom of my
soul, and caused Atala to chance countenance. Our united hands trembled in
each other. But we were diverted from this scene by another scene not less
dangerous for us.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We passed near a child&rsquo;s tomb, which served as a boundary between two
nations. It had been placed on the border of the road, according to
custom, in order that the young wives, when going to the fountain, might
draw into their bosom the soul of the innocent creature, and restore it to
the country. At this moment several newly-married spouses were there, and,
desirous of the sweets of maternity, were endeavoring, by opening their
lips, to receive the soul of the little child, which they fancied they saw
wandering amongst the flowers. The veritable mother came afterwards, and
deposited a bunch of corn and white lilies upon the tomb; she sprinkled
the earth with her milk, sat down upon the damp turf, and spoke thus to
her child in an impassioned voice:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do I weep for thee in thy earthly cradle, O my new-born? When the
little bird has grown, it must seek its own nutriment, and finds many
bitter seeds in the desert. At least thou hast been unconscious of tears;
at least thy heart has not been exposed to the devouring breath of men.
The bud that dries up in its envelope passes away with all its perfumes,
like thou, O my son, with all thine innocence. Happy are those who die in
the cradle! they have only known the kisses and smiles of a mother!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Already subdued by our own hearts, we were overwhelmed by the images of
love and maternity which seemed to pursue us in these enchanted solitudes.
I carried Atala away in my arms to the extremity of the forest, where I
told her things that I should in vain endeavor to repeat to-day with my
lips. The southern wind, my dear son, loses its heat on passing over
mountains of ice. The souvenirs of love in the heart of an old man are
like the fires of day reflected by the peaceful orb of the moon when the
sun has set, and silence spreads itself over the huts of the savages.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What could save Atala? what could prevent her from succumbing to Nature?
Nothing, doubtless, but a miracle; and that miracle was accomplished. The
daughter of Simaghan had recourse to the God of the Christians; she threw
herself upon the ground, and uttered a fervent prayer, addressed to her
mother and to the Queen of Virgins. It was from this moment, O René, that
I entertained a wonderful idea of that religion which, in the forests, in
the midst of all the privations of life, imparts a thousand boons to the
unfortunate; of that religion which, opposing its power to the torrent of
the passions, suffices alone to conquer them, when everything else is in
their favor&mdash;the secrecy of the woods, the absence of men, and the
fidelity of the shades. Ah, how divine to me appeared that simple savage,
the ignorant Atala, who, on her knees before an old fallen pine-tree, as
at the foot of an altar, was offering up a prayer to her God in favor of
an idolatrous lover! Her eyes raised towards the star of the night, her
cheeks, brilliant with tears of religion and of love, were of immortal
beauty. Several times it appeared to me as though she were about to take
her flight to heaven; several times I fancied I saw come down upon the
rays of the moon, and heard amidst the trees, those genii whom the God of
the Christians sends to the hermits of the rocks when He is about to call
them back to Himself. I was afflicted by all this, for I feared that Atala
had but little time to remain on earth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, she shed such abundant tears, she appeared so unhappy, that
I was perhaps upon the point of consenting to take my departure, when the
cry of death resounded through the forest. Four armed men rushed upon me.
We had been discovered; the war-chief had given orders for our pursuit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala, who resembled a queen in the pride of her demeanor, disdained to
speak to these warriors. She glanced nobly at them, and went forthwith to
Simaghan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She could obtain no concession. My guards were doubled, my chains
increased, and my lover was kept away from me. Five nights passed, and
then we perceived Apalachucla, situated on the banks of the river
Chata-Uche. I was immediately crowned with flowers; my face was painted
blue and red; beads were fastened to my nose and to my ears, and a
chichikoué * was placed in my hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thus prepared for the sacrifice, I entered Apalachucla amidst the
reiterated shouts of the crowd. My fate was sealed; when all of a sudden
the sound of a conch was heard, and the mico, or chief of the nation,
ordered an assembly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know, my son, the torments to which savages subject their prisoners
of war. Christian missionaries, at the risk of their lives, and with an
indefatigable charity, had succeeded in inducing several nations to
substitute a comparatively mild slavery to the horrors of the funeral
pile. The Muscogulges had not yet adopted this custom, but a numerous
party amongst them had declared themselves in favor of it. It was to
decide upon this important matter that the mico had convoked the sachems,
or wise men. I was conducted to the place of deliberation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The pavilion of the council was situated upon an isolated mound not far
from Apalachucla. Three circles of columns constituted the elegant
architecture of this rotunda. The columns were of polished and carved
cypress-wood, increasing in height and in thickness, and diminishing in
number as they approached the centre, which was indicated by a single
pillar. From the summit of this pillar depended strips of bark, which,
passing over the tops of the other columns, covered the pavilion in the
guise of an open fan.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* A musical instrument played by the savages.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;The council assembled. Fifty old men, in beaver cloaks, were ranged upon
the steps facing the door of the pavilion. The grand chief was seated in
their midst, holding in his hand the calumet of peace, half-colored for
war. On the right of the old men were placed fifty women, dressed in robes
of swan-feathers. The war-chiefs, with a tomahawk in the hand, a bunch of
feathers on the head, and their arms and chests dyed with blood, occupied
the left.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the foot of the central column the fire of the council was burning.
The first jungler, surrounded by eight guardians of the temple, dressed in
long vestments, and wearing a stuffed owl upon their heads, poured some
balm of copal upon the flames, and offered a sacrifice to the sun. The
triple row of old men, matrons, and warriors&mdash;the priests, the clouds
of incense, and the sacrifice&mdash;imparted to this council an aspect
altogether imposing.

</h4>
<p>
&ldquo;I was standing chained in the midst of the assembly. When the sacrifice
was finished, the mico spoke, and explained with simplicity the affair
that had brought the council together. He threw a blue necklace upon the
ground, as evidence of what he had just said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then a sachem of the tribe of the Eagle rose, and spoke thus:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My father the mico, sachems, matrons, warriors of the four tribes of the
Eagle, the Beaver, the Serpent, and the Tortoise, let us change nothing in
the manners of our forefathers: let us burn the prisoner, and let us not
allow our courage to be weakened. It is a custom of the white men that is
now proposed to you; it cannot be other than pernicious. Give a red collar
which contains my words. I have spoken.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he threw a red collar into the midst of the assembly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A matron then rose, and said:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My father Eagle, you have the cleverness of a fox and the prudent
slowness of a tortoise. I will polish the chain of friendship with you,
and we will plant together the tree of peace. But let us change the
customs of our forefathers when they are of a terrible character. Let us
have slaves to cultivate our fields, and let us no longer hear the cries
of the prisoners, which trouble the bosoms of the mothers. I have spoken.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As the waves of the ocean are broken up by a storm; as in autumn the
dried leaves are carried away in a whirlwind; as the reeds of the
Mississippi bend and rise again during a sudden inundation; as a great
herd of deer bellow in the depths of a forest, so was the council agitated
and murmuring. Sachems, warriors, and matrons spoke by turns, or all
together. Interests clashed, opinions were divided, and the council was
about to be dissolved; but at length the ancient custom prevailed, and I
was condemned to the pile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A circumstance caused my punishment to be delayed: the Feast of the Dead,
or the Festival of Souls, was approaching, and it is the custom not to put
any captive to death during the days consecrated to that ceremony. I was
handed over to a strict guard, and doubtless the sachems had sent away the
daughter of Simaghan, as I saw her no longer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Meanwhile, the tribes for more than three hundred leagues around came in
crowds to celebrate the Festival of Souls. A long hut had been constructed
upon an isolated situation. On the day indicated, each cabin exhumed the
remains of its fathers from their private tombs, and the skeletons were
hung upon the walls of the Common-room of the Ancestors in order and by
families. The winds (a tempest had burst forth), the forests, and the
cataracts roared from without, while the old men of the different nations
were engaged in concluding treaties of peace between the tribes over the
bones of their fathers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Funeral amusements were indulged in, running, ball, and a game with small
bones. Two maidens tried to snatch from each other a willow-twig. Their
hands fluttered about the twig, which each in her turn held above her
head. Their beautiful naked feet intertwined, their mouths met, their
sweet breaths became confounded; they stooped, and their hairs were mixed
together; then they looked at their mothers, and blushed in the midst of
applause. * The jungler invoked Michabou, the genius of the waters, and
related the wars of the great Hare against Machimanitou, the god of evil.
He spoke of the first man, and of Athaënsic, the first woman, being hurled
from heaven for having lost their innocence; of the earth having been
reddened with a brother&rsquo;s blood; of the immolation of Tahouistsarou by the
impious Jouskeka; of the deluge commanded by the voice of the Great
Spirit; of Massou, the only one saved in his bark vessel; and of the crow
sent out to discover the land. He spoke, moreover, of the beautiful Endaë,
recalled from the land of souls by the sweet songs of her spouse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After these games and hymns, preparations were made for giving the
ancestors an eternal sepulture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Upon the borders of the river Chata-Uche there was a wild fig-tree, which
the worship of the people had consecrated. The Indian maidens were in the
habit of washing their bark-dresses at this place, and exposing them to
the breath of the desert upon the branches of the ancient tree. It was
there that an immense tomb had been dug.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;While leaving the funeral chamber, the hymn of death was sung. Each
family carried some sacred remains. On arriving at the tomb, the relics
were lowered down into it, and spread out in layers, separated by the
skins of bears and beavers; the mound of the tomb was then raised, and the
tree of tears and of sleep planted upon it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us pity men, my dear son! Those very Indians whose customs are so
touching, those very women who had displayed such a tender interest in my
behalf, now called out loudly for my execution; and entire tribes delayed
their departure, in order to have the pleasure of seeing a young man
undergo the most horrible sufferings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In a valley to the north, at some distance from the grand village, was a
wood of cypresses and deals, called the Wood of Blood. It was reached by
the ruins of one of those monuments of which the origin is ignored, and
which were the work of a people now unknown. I was led thither in triumph.
Preparations were being made for my death. The pole of Areskoui was
planted; pine, elm, and cypress-trees fell beneath the axe; the funeral
pile was rising, and spectators were constructing amphitheatres with the
branches and trunks of trees. Each one was occupied in inventing a
torture. Some proposed to tear the skin off my head, others to burn my
eyes out with red-hot axes. I began to sing the song of death:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Blushing is a marked characteristic with young savages.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not fear torture: I am brave, O Muscognlges! I defy you; I despise
you more than women. My father, Outalissi, son of Miscou, drank out of the
skulls of your most famous warriors; you will not draw a sigh from my
breast.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Provoked by my song, a warrior pierced my arm with an arrow. I merely
said, &lsquo;Brother, I thank thee.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In spite of the activity of the executioners, the preparations for my
execution could not be completed before the setting of the sun. A jungler
was consulted, and he forbade the genii of the shades to be troubled, so
that my death was postponed till the following day. But, in their
impatience to enjoy the spectacle, and in order to be ready sooner on the
break of day, the Indians did not quit the Wood of Blood. They lighted
large fires, and began a series of festivities and dances.

<p>
&ldquo;Meanwhile, I had been laid down upon my back. Cords from my neck, from my
feet, and from my arms, were attached to stakes fixed in the ground.
Warriors were seated upon these cords, and I could not make the slightest
movement without their knowledge. The night advanced; the songs and dances
gradually ceased; the fires emitted but a ruddy light, in front of which I
could see the shadows of some of the savages pass. At last they all fell
asleep; but as the noise of men became pacified, that of the desert seemed
to increase, and to the tumult of voices succeeded the howlings of the
winds in the forest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the hour when a young Indian recently become a mother awakes with
a start in the middle of the night, fancying she has heard the cry of her
first-born babe desirous of her sweet nutriment. With my eyes gazing up to
heaven, where the crescent moon was wandering in the clouds, I was
reflecting upon my destiny. Atala appeared to me to be a monster of
ingratitude thus to abandon me at the moment of punishment&mdash;I, who
had given myself up to the flames rather than leave her! And yet I felt
that I still loved her, and that I should die with joy for Atala.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In extreme pleasures there is a sting that excites one as though to
counsel us to profit by the rapidly passing moment: in great grief, on the
contrary, there is something heavy that induces drowsiness; the eyes
fatigued with tears naturally seek to close, and the goodness of
Providence may be thus remarked even in our misfortunes. I gave way, in
spite of myself, to that heavy sleep which sometimes overcomes the
wretched. I dreamt that my chains were being taken off; I thought I felt
the satisfaction experienced when, after having been tightly pressed, a
helping hand relieves us of our irons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This sensation was so vivid that it caused me to raise my eyelids. By the
light of the moon, a ray of which was escaping between two clouds, I saw a
tall white figure leaning over me, and silently occupied in loosening my
bonds. I was about to utter a cry, when a hand, which I instantly
recognized, closed my mouth. A single cord remained, but it appeared
impossible to cut it without touching a warrior who covered it entirely
with his body. Atala placed her hand upon it. The warrior, half-awakened,
bestirred himself, and sat up. Atala remained motionless, and looked at
him. The Indian thought he was looking at the Spirit of the ruins; and he
lay down again, closing his eyes and invoking his manitou. The bond was
broken. I arose and followed my deliverer, who tendered to me the end of a
bow of which she held the other extremity. But with what dangers were we
surrounded! At times we were on the point of stumbling over the sleeping
savages; then a guard questioned us, and Atala replied in an assumed
voice. Children were crying, and dogs barking. Scarcely had we got clear
of the fatal enclosure, when terrible howlings resounded through the
forest. The camp was aroused. A thousand fires were lighted, and savages
were running about in all directions with torches. We hurried away with
precipitation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When day broke upon the Apalaches, we were already far away. Great was my
felicity on finding myself again in solitude with Atala&mdash;with Atala
my deliverer, with Atala who was giving herself to me for ever! Words
failed my tongue. I fell on my knees, and said to the daughter of
Simaghan: &lsquo;Men are but little; but when the genii visit them, they are
nothing at all. You are a genius; you have visited me, and I cannot speak
before you.&rsquo; Atala offered me her hand with a smile: &lsquo;I am obliged to
follow you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;since you will not fly without me. During the
night I seduced the jungler with presents, I intoxicated your executioners
with essence of fire, * and I risked my life for you, because you had
given yours for me. Yes, young idolator!&rsquo; she added, with an accent that
alarmed me, &lsquo;the sacrifice will be reciprocal.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala gave me the weapons she had had the precaution to bring, and then
she dressed my wound. Whilst wiping it with a papaya-leaf, she wetted it
with her tears. &lsquo;It is a balm,&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;that you are dropping on
my arm.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am rather afraid that it may be a poison,&rsquo; she replied. She
tore one of the coverings from her bosom, with which she made a first
bandage that she fastened with a tress of lier hair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Intoxication, which lasts a long time upon savages, and is for them a
species of malady, prevented them from pursuing us during the first few
days. If they sought for us afterwards, it was probably in a westerly
direction, as they must have thought we should make for the Mississippi;
but we had taken our flight towards the fixed star, ** guiding ourselves
by the moss on the trunks of the trees.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Brandy.

** The north.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;We were not long in perceiving that we had gained but little by my
deliverance. The desert now unrolled before us its immeasurable solitudes.
Without experience in forest life, having lost our way, and walking on at
hazard, what was to become of us? Often, while gazing upon Atala, I
remembered the ancient story of Agar, that Lopez had given me to read, and
which happened in the desert of Beersheba a long time ago, when men lived
to three times the age of the oak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala made me a cloak out of some ash-bark, and she also embroidered me a
pair of musk rat skin moccasins with porcupine&rsquo;s hair. In my turn, I did
all in my power to ornament her attire. First of all, I placed upon her
head a crown of those blue mallows that crowded beneath our feet in the
abandoned Indian cemeteries; then I made her necklaces of red
azalea-berries; and after all I smiled in the contemplation of her
wonderful beauty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When we encountered a river, we crossed it either on a raft or by
swimming. Atala placed one of her hands upon my shoulder, and thus, like a
pair of migratory swans, we traversed the solitary waves.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;During the great heat of the day we often sought shelter beneath the moss
of the cedars. Nearly all the Floridan trees, especially the cedar and the
oak, are covered with a white moss, which descends from their branches
down to the very ground. At night-time, by moonlight, should you happen to
see, in the open savannah, an isolated holm dressed in such drapery, you
would imagine it to be a phantom dragging after it a number of long veils.
The scene is not less picturesque by day, when a crowd of butterflies,
brilliant insects, colibris, green paroquets, and blue jackdaws entangle
themselves amongst the moss, and thus produce the effect of a piece of
white woollen tapestry embroidered by some clever European workman with
beautiful birds and sparkling insects.

<p>
&ldquo;It was in the shade of such smiling quarters, prepared by the Great
Spirit, that we stopped to repose ourselves. When the winds come down from
heaven to rock the great cedar, when the aerial castles built upon its
brandies undulate with the birds and the travellers sleeping beneath its
shelter, when thousands of sighs pass through the corridors of the waving
edifice, there is nothing amongst the wonders of the ancient world to be
compared with this monument of the desert.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every evening we lighted a large fire and built a travelling hut of bark
raised upon four stakes. When I had killed a wild turkey, a pigeon, or a
wood-pheasant, we attached it to the end of a pole before a pile of
burning oak, and left the care of turning the hunter&rsquo;s prey to the
caprices of the wind. We used to eat a kind of moss called rock-tripe,
sweetened bark, and May-apples, that tasted of the peach and the
raspberry. The black-walnut-tree, the maple-tree, and the sumach furnished
our table with wine. Sometimes I went and fetched from amongst the reeds a
plant whose flower, in the form of an elongated cup, contained a glass of
the purest dew. We blessed Heaven for having placed this limpid spring
upon the stalk of a flower, in the midst of the corrupted marshes, just as
it has placed hope at the bottom of hearts ulcerated by grief; just also
as it has caused virtue to well up from the bosom of the miseries of life!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I soon discovered, alas! that I had deceived myself as to the apparent
calm of my beloved Atala. The farther we advanced the sadder she became.
She frequently shuddered without a cause, and turned her head aside
hurriedly. I sometimes caught her regarding me with a passionate look,
which she at once cast towards the sky with a profound melancholy. What
alarmed me above all was a secret thought concealed in the bottom of her
soul, but which I read in her eyes. Constantly drawing me towards her and
then pushing me away, re-animating my hopes, and then destroying them when
I thought I had made some progress in her heart, I found myself still at
the same point. How many times she said to me, &lsquo;O my young sweetheart! I
love you like the shade of the woods at mid-day!&rsquo; You are as beautiful as
the desert with all its flowers and all its breezes. If I incline towards
you, I tremble: when my hand falls upon yours, it seems to me as though I
were about to die. The other day the wind blew your hair upon my face as
you were reposing yourself upon my bosom, and I fancied I felt the light
touch of the invisible spirits. Yes, I have seen the young kids of the
mountain of Occona; I have listened to the language of men ripe with
years; but the mildness of goats and the wisdom of old men are less
agreeable and less powerful than your words. Ah, my poor Chactas! I shall
never be your spouse!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The constant struggle between Atala&rsquo;s love and religion, her tender
freedom and the chastity of her conduct, the pride of her character and
her profound sensitiveness, the elevation of her soul in great things, her
susceptibility about trifles, rendered her, in my opinion, an
incomprehensible being. Atala could not hold a weak empire over a man.
Full of passion, she was full of power. She must either be adored or
hated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After fifteen nights of hurried march, we entered upon the chain of the
Alleghany mountains, and reached one of the branches of the Tennessee, a
river that falls into the Ohio. Aided by the advice of Atala, I built a
boat, which I coated with plum-tree gum, after having re-sewn the bark
with roots of the fir. I subsequently embarked therein with Atala, and we
abandoned ourselves to the current of the river.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Indian village of Sticoë, with its pyramidal tombs and ruined huts,
appeared on our left at the turn of a promontory; on the right we left the
valley of Keow, terminated by the perspective of the cabins of Jore, which
seemed to be suspended from the forehead of the mountain of the same name.
The river which carried us along flowed between high cliffs, at the
extremity of which we perceived the setting sun. The profound solitudes
were not disturbed by the presence of men. We only saw one Indian hunter,
who, leaning motionless upon his bow, on the peak of a rock, looked like a
statue raised upon the mountain to the genius of those deserts.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala and myself added our silence to the silence of this scene. All of a
sudden, the daughter of exile filled the air by thus singing, in a voice
replete with melancholy emotion, of her absent country:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and who
have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their fathers!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;If the blue jackdaw of the Mississippi were to say to the nonpareil of
the Floridas, &ldquo;Why dost thou complain so sadly? Hast thou not here
beautiful waters and lovely shades, and all sorts of pastures, as in thine
own forests?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; would reply the fugitive nonpareil; &ldquo;but my nest is in the
jessamine; who will bring it to me? And the sun of my savannah, where is
it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and who
have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their fathers!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;After hours of painful wayfare, the traveller sits down in sadness. He
sees around him the roofs of men&rsquo;s habitations, but has no place wherein
to repose his head. The traveller knocks at a cabin, places his bow behind
the door, and asks for hospitality. The master makes a gesture of the
hand; the traveller takes back his bow, and returns to the desert.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and who
have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their fathers!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wondrous stories told around the hearth, tender effusions of the heart,
long habits of loving so necessary to life, you have filled the days of
those who have not quitted their natal place! Their tombs are in the land
of their birth, with the setting sun, the tears of their friends and the
charms of religion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and who
have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their fathers!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thus sang Atala. Nothing interrupted the course of her lamentations,
except the almost imperceptible sound of our boat upon the waves. In two
or three places only were they taken up by a weak echo, which repeated
them to a second, and the second to a third, faintly and more faintly
still. It seemed as though the souls of two lovers, formerly unfortunate
like ourselves, and attracted by the touching melody, were enjoying the
pleasure of sighing forth the dying sounds of its music in the mountain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, the solitude, the constant presence of the beloved object,
even our misfortunes, increased our affection from one instant to another.
Atala prayed continuously to her mother, whose irritated shade she seemed
as though wishing to appease. She sometimes asked me if I did not hear a
plaintive voice, and see flames issuing out of the earth. As for myself,
exhausted with fatigue, but still burning with desire, and thinking that I
was perhaps irretrievably lost in the midst of those forests, I was a
hundred times upon the point of drawing my spouse to my arms, and a
hundred times did I urge Atala to allow me to build a hut upon the river
side, so that we might bury ourselves therein together. But she always
resisted my propositions. &lsquo;Remember, my young friend,&rsquo; she would say,
‘that a warrior owes himself to his country. What is a woman compared to
the duties you have to fulfil? Take courage, son of Outalissi; do not
murmur against your destiny. The heart of man is like a river-sponge, that
imbibes pure water during calm weather, and is swollen with muddy liquid
when the sky has troubled the waves. Has the sponge the right to say, &ldquo;I
thought there would never be any storms, and that the sun would never be
scorching?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O René, if you fear the trials of the heart, be upon your guard against
solitude. The great passions are solitary, and to transport them to the
desert is to restore them to their triumph. Overcome with cares and fears;
exposed to the danger of falling into the hands of Indian enemies, to be
swallowed up by the waters, stung by serpents, devoured by beasts; finding
the poorest nourishment with difficulty, and not knowing whither to direct
our steps, it seemed impossible for our misfortunes to be greater, when an
accident brought them to a climax.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the twenty-seventh sun since our departure from the cabins. The
moon of fire had commenced her course, and everything announced a storm.
Towards the hour when the Indian matrons hang up the plough-handle to the
branches of the sabin-tree, and when the paroquets retire into the hollows
of the cypress, the sky began to be overcast. The voices of the solitude
died away, the desert became silent, and the forests were reposing in the
midst of a universal calm. Shortly after, the rollings of a distant
thunder, prolonged through the woods as old as the world, re-issued from
them with sublime sounds. Fearful of being submerged, we hastened to reach
the bank of the river, and withdrew into a forest.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The month of July.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;The ground in this place was marshy. We advanced with difficulty under a
vault of smilax, amidst vines, indigo-plants, bean-trees, and creeping ivy
that entangled our feet like nets. The spongy soil trembled around us, and
at each instant we were on the point of sinking into the quagmires.
Insects without number, and enormous bats, blinded us; bell-serpents were
hissing in every direction, and wolves, bears, carcajous, and young
tigers, come to hide themselves in these retreats, made them resound with
their roarings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Meanwhile, the darkness increased. The lowering clouds were entering
beneath the leafy covering of the woods. Suddenly the sky was rent, and
the lightning traced a rapid zig-zag of fire. A violent wind from the west
rolled clouds upon clouds; the forests bent; the sky opened time after
time, and from between the interstices other skies and ardent scenes might
be perceived. What a frightful, what a magnificent spectacle! The
lightning set fire to the forest; the conflagration extended like a
head-dress of flame; columns of sparks and of smoke besieged the clouds,
which were vomiting their flashes into the vast burning mass. Then the
Great Spirit covered the mountain with heavy darkness; and from the midst
of this chaos there arose a confused moaning, formed by the rushing of the
winds, the cracking of trees, the howling of wild beasts, the buzzing of
the inflamed vegetation, and the repeated fall of thunderbolts hissing as
they died out in the waters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Great Spirit knows that at this moment I saw and thought of nothing
but Atala. I managed to guard her against the torrents of rain by placing
her beneath the inclining trunk of a birch-tree, under which I sat down,
holding my well-beloved upon my knees, and warming her naked feet between
my hands; and thus I found myself happier than the young spouse who feels
her future offspring quiver in her bosom for the first time.

<p>
&ldquo;We were listening to the sound of the tempest, when all of a sudden I
felt one of Atala&rsquo;s tears fall upon my breast. &lsquo;Storm of the heart,&rsquo; I
cried to myself, &lsquo;is it a drop of your rain?&rsquo; Then embracing her I loved,
I said, &lsquo;Atala, you are concealing something from me. Open your heart to
me, O beauty! It does one so much good when a friend looks into one&rsquo;s
soul. Tell me this secret of grief which you persist in hiding from me.
Ah! I see you are weeping for your country.&rsquo; She immediately retorted,
‘Child of men, why should I weep for my country, since my father came not
from the land of palms?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I replied, with profound
astonishment, &lsquo;your father was not from the land of palms! What was he
then who brought you upon this earth? Reply!&rsquo; Atala answered in these
words:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Before my mother brought to the warrior Simaghan, as a marriage portion,
thirty mares, twenty buffaloes, a hundred measures of nut-oil, fifty
beaver-skins, and a quantity of other riches, she had known a man of white
flesh. Now the mother of my mother threw water in her face, and forced her
to marry the magnanimous Simaghan, who was like unto a king, and honored
by the people as a genius. But my mother said to her new spouse, &ldquo;My bosom
has conceived; kill me.&rdquo; Simaghan replied to her, &ldquo;May the Great Spirit
preserve me from such an action! I will not mutilate you. I will neither
cut off your nose nor your ears, because you have been sincere and have
not betrayed my couch. The fruit of your bosom shall be my fruit, and I
will not visit you till after the departure of the bird of the
rice-fields, when the thirteenth moon shall have shone.&rdquo; About that time I
issued from my mother&rsquo;s bosom, and I began to grow, proud as a Spaniard
and as a savage. My mother made me a Christian, so that her God and the
God of my father might also be my God. Afterwards love-sickness fell upon
her, and she went down into the little pit furnished with skins, from
which no one ever comes out.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such was Atala&rsquo;s story. &lsquo;And who was your father, then, poor orphan?&rsquo; I
said to her; &lsquo;how was he called by men upon earth, and what name did he
bear among the genii?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I never washed my father&rsquo;s feet,&rsquo; said
Atala: &lsquo;I only know that he lived with his sister at Saint Augustine, and
that he ever remained faithful to my mother. Philip was his name amongst
the angels, and men called him Lopez.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At these words I uttered a cry which re-echoed throughout the solitude;
the soumis of my transports mingled with those of the storm. Pressing
Atala to my heart, I exclaimed with sobs, &lsquo;O my sister! O daughter of
Lopez! daughter of my benefactor!&rsquo; Atala, alarmed, sought to ascertain the
cause of my agitation; but when she learnt that Lopez was the generous
host who had adopted me at Saint Augustine, and whom I had quitted in
order to be free, she was herself stricken with joy and confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This fraternal friendship which came upon us and joined its love to our
love, was too much for our hearts. Already had I intoxicated myself with
her breath, already had I drunk all the magic of love upon her lips. With
my eyes raised towards heaven, amidst the flash of the lightnings, I held
my spouse in my arms in the presence of the Eternal. Splendid pomp, worthy
of our misfortunes and of the grandeur of our loves; superb forests, that
shook your creeping plants and your leafy domes as though they were to be
the curtains and the canopy of our couch; overflowing river, roaring
mountains, frightful and sublime Nature, were you then but a combination
prepared to deceive us, and could you not for one moment conceal a man&rsquo;s
felicity amidst your mysterious horrors?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Suddenly a vivid flash, followed by a clap of thunder, ran through the
thickness of the shades, filled the forest with sulphur and light, and
rent a tree close by us. We fled. O surprise! In the silence which
followed, we heard the sound of a bell. Both speechless, we listened to
the sound, so strange in a desert. At the same instant a dog barked in the
distance. It approached, redoubled its cries, came up to us, and howled
with joy at our feet. An old hermit, carrying a small lantern, was
following the animal through the darkness of the forest. &lsquo;Heaven be
praised!&rsquo; he cried, as soon as he perceived us; &lsquo;I have been looking for
you a long time! Our dog smelt you as soon as the storm commenced, and has
guided me hither. Poor children, how young you are, and how you must have
suffered! Come; I have brought a bear-skin. It shall be for this young
woman, and there is some wine in our gourd. Let God be praised in all His
works! His mercy is great and His goodness is infinite!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala threw herself at the feet of the monk. &lsquo;Chief of prayer,&rsquo; said she
to him, &lsquo;I am a Christian. Heaven has sent you to save me!&rsquo; &lsquo;My daughter,&rsquo; 
said the hermit, raising her up, &lsquo;we usually ring the mission-bell during
the night and during tempests, to call strangers; and, in imitation of the
example of our brethren of the Alps and of the Liban, we have taught our
dog to discover lost travellers.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely understood the hermit. This charity appeared to me so much
above man that I thought I was dreaming. By the light of the little
lantern the monk was holding in his hand I saw that his beard and hair
were saturated with water; his feet, his hands, and his face were
bleeding: from their encounters with the brambles. &lsquo;Old man!&rsquo; I at length
cried, &lsquo;what sort of heart have you, that you did not fear being struck by
the lightning?&rsquo; &lsquo;Fear!&rsquo; retorted the father, with a certain ardor, &lsquo;fear
when men are in danger and I can be useful to them! I should in that case
be an unworthy servant of Jesus Christ!&rsquo; &lsquo;But do you know,&rsquo; I interrupted,
‘that I am not a Christian?&rsquo; &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; replied the hermit, &lsquo;did I ask
you your religion? Jesus Christ did not say, &ldquo;My blood shall wash this one
or that one.&rdquo; He died for the Jew and for the Gentile, and He only
considered all the races of men as brothers in misfortune. What I am now
doing for you is but little, and you would find elsewhere plenty of other
help; but the glory of it should not fall upon the priests. What are we
poor hermits, if not the coarse instruments of a celestial work? And what
soldier would be cowardly enough to retreat when his Chief, with the cross
in His hand and His forehead covered with thorns, marches before him to
the assistance of suffering humanity?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These words went to my heart; tears of admiration and tenderness fell
from my eyes. &lsquo;My dear children,&rsquo; said the missionary, &lsquo;I govern in these
forests a little flock of your wild brethren. My grotto is not far from
here, in the mountain. Come and warm yourselves under my roof. You will
not find the conveniences of life there, but you shall have shelter, and
you should thank the Divine goodness even for that, for there are many men
who are without it.&rsquo;

<h2>
II. THE LABORERS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here are some righteous people whose conscience is so tranquil that one
cannot approach them without participating in the peace emitted, so to
say, by their heart and by their language. As the hermit went on speaking,
I felt the passions calm down in my bosom, and even the storm of heaven
appeared to recede at his voice. The clouds were soon sufficiently
dispersed to permit us to quit our retreat. We issued from the forest, and
commenced climbing a high mountain. The dog walked by our side, carrying
the extinguished lantern at the end of a stick.
</p>
<p>
I held Atala by the hand, and we followed the missionary. He frequently
turned round to look at us, and seemed to pity our youth and our
misfortunes. A book was hanging from his neck, and he leant upon a white
staff. His figure was tall, his face pale and thin, and his countenance
simple and sincere. His features showed that he had seen bad days, and the
deep wrinkles in his forehead were the noble scars of passions overcome by
virtue and by the love of God and of man. When he spoke to us standing and
motionless, his long beard, his eyes modestly cast downwards, the
affectionate tone of his voice, everything about him was calm and sublime.
Whoever, like myself, has seen Father Aubry with his breviary and staff,
on his lonely way in the desert, preserves a veritable idea of the
Christian traveller upon earth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After half an hour&rsquo;s dangerous march through the paths of the mountain,
we arrived at the missionary&rsquo;s grotto. We entered it over an accumulation
of wet ivy and wild plants, washed down from the rocks by the rain. There
was nothing in the place beyond a mat of papaya-leaves, a gourd for
drawing up water, a few wooden vessels, a spade, a harmless serpent, and,
upon a block of stone that served as a table, a crucifix and the Book of
the Christians.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man of ancient days was not long in lighting a fire with some dried
leaves. He then crushed some Indian corn between two stones, and having
made a cake with it, placed it beneath the ashes to bake. When the cake
had come to a fine golden color, he served it to us hot, with nut-cream,
in a maple bowl. The evening having restored calm, the servant of the
Great Spirit proposed that we should go and sit at the entrance to the
grotto, which commanded an immense view. The remains of the storm had been
carried in disorder towards the east; the fires of the conflagration
caused in the forests by the lightning were still shining in the distance;
at the foot of the mountain an entire pine-wood had been thrown down into
the mud, and the river was charged pell-mell with molten clay, trunks of
trees, and the bodies of dead animals and of dead fishes, floating upon
the still agitated surface of the waters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was in the midst of this scene that Atala related our history to the
old genius of the mountain. His heart appeared to be touched, and tears
fell upon his beard. &lsquo;My child,&rsquo; he said to Atala, &lsquo;you must offer your
sufferings to God, for whose glory you have already done so many things.
He will give you rest. Look at those smoking forests, those receding
torrents, those scattered clouds: do you imagine that He who can calm such
a tempest cannot appease the troubles of the heart of man? If you have no
better retreat, my dear daughter, I offer you a place amongst the flock I
have had the happiness of calling to Jesus Christ. I will instruct
Chactas, and I will give him to you as a husband when he shall have proved
himself worthy to be your spouse.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At these words I fell at the hermit&rsquo;s knees, shedding tears of joy; but
Atala became as pale as death. The old man raised me with benignity, and I
then perceived that both his hands were mutilated. Atala at once
comprehended his misfortunes. &lsquo;The barbarians!&rsquo; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My daughter,&rsquo; replied the hermit, with a pleasant smile, &lsquo;what is that
in comparison with the sufferings of my Divine Master? If the Indian
idolators have tortured me, they are poor, blind creatures, whom God will
enlighten some day. I love them all the more for the injury they have done
me. I could not remain in my country, to which I had gone back, and where
an illustrious queen did me the honor to look upon these poor marks of my
apostolate. And what more glorious reward could I receive for my labors
than that of obtaining, from the head of our religion, the permission to
celebrate the Divine sacrifice with these mutilated hands? It only
remained for me, after such an honor, to try and render myself worthy of
it; so I returned to the; new world to pass the rest of my lift: in the
service of my God. I have dwelt in these solitudes nearly thirty years,
and it will be twenty-two to-morrow since I took possession of this rock.
When I came to the place, I encountered but a few wandering families,
whose manners were ferocious and whose life was miserable. I have induced
them to listen to the word of Peace, and their manners have become
gradually softened. They now live together at the foot of this mountain.
Whilst teaching them the way of salvation, I endeavored to instruct them
in the primary arts of life, but without carrying them too far, and
constantly keeping the honest people within the bounds of that simplicity
which constitutes happiness. Fearing to trouble them by my presence, I
retired to this grotto, where they come to consult me. It is here that far
from man, I admire God in the grandeur of the solitude, and prepare myself
for the death which the length of my years announces to me as
approaching.&rsquo;

</h4>
<p>
&ldquo;On finishing this discourse, the hermit fell upon his knees, and we
imitated his example. He began in a loud voice a prayer to which Atala
responded. Some dull flashes of lightning still opened the sky in the
east, and upon the western clouds three suns seemed to be shining at the
same time.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We re-entered the grotto, where the hermit stretched out a bed of
cypress-moss for Atala. Profound language was depicted in the eyes and
movements of the maiden. She looked at Father Aubry as though she wished
to reveal a secret to him; but something appeared to deter her from so
doing&mdash;either my presence, or a sort of shame, or perhaps the
uselessness of the avowal. I heard her get up in the middle of the night.
She went to look for the hermit; but, as he had given up his couch to
Atala, he had gone to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, and to pray
to God on the top of the mountain. He told me the next day that such was
his custom, even during winter, as he loved to see the forests wave their
stripped summits, the clouds fly through the air, and to hear the winds
and the torrents roar in the solitude. My sister was therefore obliged to
return to her couch, where she immediately fell asleep. Alas! full of
hope, I thought Atala&rsquo;s weakness was nothing more than a passing sign of
weariness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The following morning I was awakened by the songs of the cardinals and
the mockingbirds, nestled in the acacias and laurels that surrounded the
grotto. I went forth and gathered a magnolia rose, and placed it, wet with
the tears of the morning, upon the head of my sleeping Atala. I hoped,
according to the religion of my country, that the soul of some child dead
at the breast might have descended upon this flower in a dew-drop, and
that a happy dream might convey it to the bosom of my future spouse. I
afterwards sought my host. I found him, his gown turned up into his two
pockets, and a chaplet in his hand, waiting for me, seated upon the trunk
of a pine-tree that had fallen from old age. He proposed that we should go
together to the Mission while Atala was still reposing. I accepted his
offer, and we immediately started on our way.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On descending the mountain, I perceived some oaks upon which the genii
seemed to have drawn foreign characters. The hermit told me that he had
traced them himself; that they were some verses of an ancient poet called
Homer, and a few sentences of another poet, more ancient still, named
Solomon. There was a sort of mysterious harmony between the wisdom of
former times, the verses eaten into by moss, the old hermit who had
engraved them, and the aged oaks which had served him for books.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His name, his age, and the date of his mission were also marked upon a
reed of the savannah at the foot of those trees. I was surprised at the
fragility of the latter monument. &lsquo;It will last longer than I,&rsquo; replied
the father, &lsquo;and it will always be of more value than the little good I
have done.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;From thence we arrived at the entrance to a valley, where I saw a
wonderful work. It was a natural bridge, similar to that in Virginia, of
which you have perhaps heard. Men, my son, especially those of your
country, often imitate Nature, and their copies are always insignificant.
It is not the same with Nature when she appears to imitate the labors of
men by in reality offering them models. Then it is that she throws bridges
from the summit of one mountain to the summit of another, suspends roads
in the air, spreads rivers for canals, carves out hills for columns, and
for basins excavates seas.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We passed beneath the sole arch of this bridge, and found ourselves in
front of another wonder, the cemetery of the Indians of the Mission, or
the Groves of Death. Father Aubry had permitted his neophytes to bury
their dead in their manner, and to continue its original name to their
place of sepulture. He had merely sanctified the place with a cross. * The
soil was divided, like fields set out for harvest, into as many lots as
there were families. Each lot formed a wood of itself, which varied
according to the taste of those who had planted it. A stream meandered
noiselessly through the groves. It went by the name of the River of Peace.
This smiling refuge of souls was closed on the east by the bridge beneath
which we had passed. Two hills bounded it on the north and on the south,
and it was open only towards the west, where stood a large forest of fir
trees. The trunks of these trees, spotted with green, and growing without
branches up to their very summits, resembled tall columns, and formed the
peristyle of this temple of death. We remarked a religious sound, similar
to the half-suppressed murmurs of an organ beneath the roof of a church;
but when we had penetrated into the interior of the sanctuary, we could
hear nothing beyond the hymns of the birds celebrating an eternal fête to
the memory of the dead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On emerging from the wood, we perceived the village of the Mission,
situated on the side of a lake, in the midst of a savannah planted with
flowers. It was reached by an avenue of magnolias and oaks, which bordered
one of &lsquo;those ancient roads met with towards the mountains that separate
Kentucky from the Floridas. As soon as the Indians saw their pastor in the
plain, they abandoned their labors, and hastened to meet him. Some of them
kissed his gown, others assisted him to walk; the mothers raised their
little children in their arms to show them the man of Jesus Christ who had
shed tears. Father Aubry inquired as he went along of what was going on in
the village. He gave counsel to one, and a mild reprimand to another, He
spoke of harvests to be gathered, of children to be instructed, of
troubles to be consoled; and he alluded to God in every topic he touched
upon.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thus escorted, we arrived at the foot of the large cross placed by the
roadside. It was here that the servant of God was in the habit of
celebrating the mysteries of his religion. &lsquo;My dear neophytes,&rsquo; said he,
turning himself towards the crowd, &lsquo;a brother and a sister have come up to
you, and, as an additional happiness, I see that Providence spared your
harvests yesterday. Behold two great reasons for thankfulness. Let us
therefore offer up the holy sacrifice, and may each of you bring to it
deep attention, a lively faith, infinite gratitude, and a humble heart!&rsquo; 
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Father Aubry had done like the Jesuits in China, who
allowed the Chinese to inter their relations in their
gardens, according to an ancient custom.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;The holy priest forthwith put on a white tunic of mulberry-bark; the
sacred cups were withdrawn from a tabernacle at the foot of the cross; the
altar was set out on a portion of the rock, water was procured from the
neighboring torrent, and a bunch of wild grapes furnished the wine for the
sacrifice. We all went down upon our knees in the high grass, and the
mystery began.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Break of day, appearing from behind the mountains, inflamed the eastern
sky. Everything in the solitude was golden or roseate. The sun, announced
by so much splendor, at length issued from an abyss of light, and its
first ray fell upon the consecrated host, which the priest was at that
very moment raising in the air.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After the sacrifice, during which nothing was wanting to me but the
daughter of Lopez, we went to the village. The most touching mixture of
social and natural life reigned there. By the side of a cypress-wood of
the ancient desert was a nascent vegetation; ears of corn rolled like gold
about the trunk of a fallen oak, and summer sheaves replaced the tree of
three centuries. On all sides forests given up to the flames were sending
up their smoke into the air, and the plough was being pushed slowly
through the remains of their roots. Surveyors with long chains went to
measure the ground; arbitrators marked out the first properties; the bird
gave up its nest; the den of the wild beast was converted into a cabin;
forges were heard to roar, and the blows of the axe caused the echoes to
resound for the last time as they expired with the trees which had served
them for a refuse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wandered with delight in the midst of these scenes, rendered still more
enchanting by the image of Atala and by the dreams of felicity with which
I was feeding my heart. I admired the triumph of Christianity over savage
life. I saw the Indian becoming civilized by the voice of religion; I
assisted at the primitive union of man and the earth&mdash;man, by this
great contract, abandoning to the earth the inheritance of his labors; and
the earth undertaking in return to bear faithfully the harvests, the sons,
and the ashes of man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;During this time a child was presented to the missionary, who baptized it
among the flowering jessamine on the border of a spring, whilst a coffin,
in the midst of these joys and labors, was being carried to the Groves of
Death. Two spouses received the nuptial benediction beneath an oak, and we
afterwards went to install them in a corner of the desert. The pastor
walked in front of us, blessing here and there a rock, a tree or a
fountain, as of old, according to the book of the Christians, God blessed
the untilled land when He gave it to Adam for an inheritance. This
procession, which, with the flocks, was following its venerable chief from
rock to rock, represented to my affected heart the migrations of the first
families, when Shem, with his children, advanced into an unknown world,
following the sun as his guide.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I desired to know from the hermit how he governed his flock. With great
patience he replied to me, &lsquo;I have laid down no law for them; I have
merely taught them to love one another, to pray to God, and to hope for a
better life. All the laws in the world are comprised therein. Towards the
middle of the village you may perceive a cabin somewhat larger than the
rest. It serves as a chapel during the rainy season. My children assemble
there morning and evening to praise the Lord, and when I am absent an old
man offers up the prayers; for old age, like maternity, is a sort of
priesthood. The people afterwards go to work in the fields; and although
the properties are divided, in order that each may learn something of
social economy, the harvests are deposited in the same storehouse, out of
a spirit of brotherly charity. Four old men are charged with the equal
distribution of the produce of the general labors. Add to all that our
religious ceremonies, plenty of hymns, the cross where I celebrate the
mysteries, the elm-tree beneath which I preach in fine weather, our tombs
near our corn-fields, our rivers into which I plunge the little children,
and the Saint Johns of this new Bethany, and you will have a complete idea
of this kingdom of Jesus Christ.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The language of the hermit delighted me, and I felt the superiority of
this stable and busy life over the wandering and idle existence of the
savage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, René! I do not repine against Providence, yet I confess I never think
of that evangelical society without experiencing bitter regret. How a hut,
with Atala, in that neighborhood, would have rendered my life happy! There
all my wanderings would have ceased; there, with a spouse, ignored by men
and concealing my happiness in the depths of the forest, my days would
have flown by like those rivers which have not even a name in the desert.
Instead of the peace I was then bold enough to promise myself, amidst what
troubles have my years been cast! The constant plaything of fortune,
wrecked upon every shore, long an exile from my country, and on my return
thither finding only a ruined cabin and friends in the tomb&mdash;such was
to be the destiny of Chactas.

<h2>
III. THE DRAMA.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f my dream of happiness was bright, it was also of short duration, and I
was to be awakened from it at the hermit&rsquo;s grotto. On arriving there in
the middle of the clay, I was surprised at not seeing Atala come forth to
meet us. I cannot tell what sudden apprehension took possession of me. As
we approached the grotto, I dared not call the daughter of Lopez; my
imagination was equally frightened by the idea of the noise or of the
silence that might follow my cries. Still more terrified by the dark
appearance of the entrance to the rock, I said to the missionary, &lsquo;O you,
whom heaven accompanies and strengthens, penetrate into those shades!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How weak is the man who is governed by his passions! How strong is he who
relies upon God! There was more courage in that religious heart, withered
by seventy-six years, than in all the ardor of my youth. The man of peace
entered the grotto, whilst I remained outside, full of terror. Soon a
feeble murmur of complaint issued from the interior of the rock, and fell
upon my ear. Uttering a cry as I recovered my strength, I rushed into the
darkness of the cavern. Spirits of my fathers, you alone know the
spectacle that met my view!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The hermit had lighted a pine-torch, which he was holding with a
trembling hand over Atala&rsquo;s couch. With her hair in disorder, the young
and beautiful woman, slightly raised upon her elbow, looked pale and
suffering. Drops of painful sweat shone upon her forehead; her
half-extinguished eyes still sought to express her love to me, and her
mouth endeavored to smile. As though struck by lightning, with my eyes
fixed, my arms outstretched, and my lips apart, I remained motionless. A
profound silence reigned for a moment between the three personages of this
scene of grief. The hermit was the first to break it. &lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said,
‘can only be a fever occasioned by fatigue, and if we resign ourselves to
God&rsquo;s will, He will take pity on us.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At these words my heart revived, and, with the mobility of the savage, I
passed suddenly from an excess of fear to an excess of confidence, from
which, however, Atala soon aroused me. Shaking her head sadly, she made us
a sign to approach her couch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My father,&rsquo; she said, in a weak voice, addressing herself to the hermit,
‘I am upon the point of death. O Chactas! listen without despair to the
fatal secret I had concealed from you in order not to make you too
miserable, and out of obedience to my mother. Try not to interrupt me by
any marks of grief, which would shorten the few moments I have to live. I
have many things to tell of, and from the beatings of my heart, which
slacken&mdash;I do not know what icy burden presses within my bosom&mdash;I
feel that I cannot make too much haste!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After a short silence, Atala continued thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My sad destiny began almost before I had seen the light. My mother had
conceived me in misfortune. I wearied her bosom, and she brought me into
the world with such painful difficulty that my life was despaired of. To
save me, my mother made a vow. She promised the Queen of Angels that I
should consecrate myself to an unwedded life if I escaped from death. That
fatal vow is now hurrying me to the tomb!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I was entering upon my sixteenth year when I lost my mother. Some hours
before her death she called me to her bedside. &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; she said, in
the presence of the missionary who was consoling her last moments, &ldquo;you
know the vow I made for you. Would you belie your mother? O my Atala, I am
leaving you in a world that is not worthy of possessing a Christian&mdash;in
the midst of idolators who persecute the God of your father and of your
mother, the God who, after having given you life, has preserved it to you
by a miracle. Ah, my dear child, by accepting the virgin&rsquo;s veil, you only
renounce the cares of the cabin and the fatal passions which have
tormented your mother&rsquo;s breast! Come, then, my well-beloved, come; swear
upon this image of the Saviour&rsquo;s Mother, held by the hands of this holy
priest and of your dying parent, that you will not betray me in the face
of heaven. Remember what I promised for you in order to save your life,
and that, if you do not keep my promise, you will plunge your mother&rsquo;s
soul into eternal tortures.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;O my mother, why spake you thus? O Religion, the cause of my ills and of
my felicity, my ruin and my consolation at the same time! And you, dear
and sad object of a passion that is consuming me even in the arms of
death, you can now see, O Chactas, what has caused the hardship of our
destiny! Melting into tears, and throwing myself upon my mother&rsquo;s bosom, I
promised all that I was asked to promise. The missionary pronounced over
me the fearful language of my oath, and gave me the scapulary that bound
me forever. My mother threatened me with her malediction if ever I broke
my vow; and, after having advised me to keep the secret inviolably from
the pagans, the persecutors of my religion, she expired, whilst holding me
in a tender embrace.

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I did not at first know the danger of my oath. Full of ardor and a
veritable Christian, proud, too, of the Spanish blood that flowed in my
veins, I saw myself surrounded by men unworthy of receiving my hand, and I
congratulated myself upon having no other spouse than the God of my
mother. I saw you, young and beautiful prisoner; I pitied your lot; I had
the courage to speak to you at the funeral pile in the forest. Then it was
that I felt the weight of my vows!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When Atala had finished littering these words, I cried out, with clenched
fists, and looking at the missionary with a threatening air, &lsquo;This, then,
is the religion you have so much vaunted to me! Perish the oath that
deprives me of Atala! Man-priest, why did you come into these forests?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘"To save you,&rsquo; said the old man, in a terrible voice; &lsquo;to conquer your
passions, and to prevent you, blasphemer, from drawing down upon yourself
the wrath of Heaven! It is becoming, indeed, for so young a man, scarcely
entered upon life, to complain of his griefs! Where are the marks of your
sufferings? Where are the acts of injustice you have had to support? Where
are your virtues, which alone could give you a certain right to murmur?
What services have you rendered? What good have you done? What, miserable
creature! you can only show me passions, and you dare to accuse Heaven!
When, like Father Aubry, you shall have passed thirty years in exile upon
the mountains, you will be less prompt to judge of the designs of
Providence. You will then understand that you know nothing and are
nothing, and that there is no chastisement so severe, no misfortune so
terrible, that our corrupt flesh does not deserve to suffer.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The lightnings that flashed from the old man&rsquo;s eyes, the beatings of his
beard against his breast, and his fiery language, made him like to a god.
Overcome by his majesty, I fell at the father&rsquo;s knees, and asked pardon
for my anger. &lsquo;My son,&rsquo; he replied, in a tone so mild that a feeling of
remorse entered my soul, &lsquo;it was not for myself that I reprimanded you.
Alas! you are right, my dear child: I have done but very little in these
forests, and God has no servant more unworthy than myself. But, my son, it
is Heaven&mdash;Heaven, I say&mdash;that should never be accused! Pardon
me if I have offended you, and let us listen to your sister. There may
still perhaps be some remedy; do not let us tire of hoping. Chactas, the
religion which has made a virtue of hope is a Divine religion!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My young friend,&rsquo; resumed Atala, &lsquo;you have been a witness of my
struggles, and nevertheless you have seen but the smallest portion of
them. I concealed the rest from you. No; the black slave who moistens the
hot sands of the Floridas with his sweat is less miserable than Atala has
been. Urging you to flight, and yet certain to die if you left me; fearful
of flying with you to the desert, and still panting after the shade of the
woods&mdash;ah! if it had only been required of me to abandon my
relations, my friends, my country! if even (frightful thought!) I should
only have incurred the loss of my soul! But thy shadow, O my mother! thy
shadow was always there, reminding me of thy tortures! I heard thy
complaints; I saw the flames of hell consuming thee. My nights were
barren, and haunted by phantoms, my days were disconsolate; the evening
dew dried as it fell upon my burning skin; I opened my lips to the
breezes, and the breezes, far from refreshing me, became heated with the
fire of my breath. What torture it was for me, Chactas, to see you
constantly near me, far from all mankind, in the depths of the solitude,
and to feel that there was an invincible barrier between you and myself!
To have passed my life at your feet, to have waited upon you like a slave,
to have prepared your repasts and your couch in some unknown corner of the
universe, would have been for me supreme happiness. That happiness was
within my reach, yet I could not enjoy it. What plans I have imagined!
What dreams have passed through this sad heart of mine! Occasionally, when
I fixed my eyes upon you, I went so far as to encourage desires that were
as foolish as they were culpable: sometimes I wished I were the only
creature living with you upon the earth: at other times, feeling a
divinity that stopped me in my horrible transports, I seemed to desire
that that divinity might be annihilated, provided that, pressed in your
arms, I might roll from abyss to abyss with the ruins of God and of the
world! Even now&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;now that eternity is about to
swallow me up, that I am going to appear before the inexorable Judge; at
the moment when, from obedience to my mother, I see with joy my vow
devouring my life; well, even now, by a frightful contradiction, I carry
away with me the regret of not having been yours&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My daughter,&rsquo; interrupted the missionary, &lsquo;your grief misleads you. The
excess of passion to which you are abandoning yourself is rarely just; it
is not even natural; and for that reason it is less culpable in the eyes
of God, because it is rather an error of the mind than a vice of the
heart. You must therefore put away such passionate feelings, which are
unworthy of your innocence. At the same time, my dear child; your
impetuous imagination has alarmed you too much concerning your vows.
Religion requires no superhuman sacrifice. Its true sentiments, its
moderated virtues, are far above the exalted sentiments and the forced
virtues of a pretending heroism. If you had succumbed&mdash;well, poor
lost sheep! the Good Shepherd would have sought for you, and would have
brought you back to the flock. The treasures of repentance were open to
you; torrents of blood are required to wipe out our faults in the eyes of
men; a single tear suffices with God. Tranquilize yourself, therefore, my
dear daughter; your situation needs calm. Let us address ourselves to God,
who heals all the wounds of His servants. If it be His will, as I trust it
may be, that you escape from this malady, I will write to the Bishop of
Quebec; he has the power to release you from your vows, which are but
simple vows; and you shall finish your days near me, with Chactas as your
spouse.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As the old man finished speaking, Atala was seized with a violent
convulsion, from which she emerged with all the signs of fearful
suffering. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said she, joining her two hands with passion, &lsquo;there
was a remedy! I could have been released from my vows!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, my
daughter,&rsquo; replied the father; &lsquo;and it is still time.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is too late it
is too late!&rsquo; she cried.
</p>
<p>
‘Must I die at the moment when I learn that I might have been happy? Why
did I not know * this old man sooner? At present what happiness should I
be enjoying with you, with my Chactas, a Christian&mdash;consoled,
comforted by this august priest&mdash;in this desert&mdash;for ever&mdash;Oh!
my felicity would have been too great!&rsquo; &lsquo;Calm yourself,&rsquo; I said to her,
taking hold of one of the unfortunate maiden&rsquo;s hands; &lsquo;calm yourself: that
happiness is still in store for us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never! never!&rsquo; said Atala. &lsquo;How?&rsquo; I
asked. &lsquo;You do not know all,&rsquo; cried the maiden. &lsquo;Yesterday&mdash;during
the storm&mdash;I was on the point of breaking my vows; I was going to
plunge my mother into the flames of the abyss. Already her malediction was
upon me, already I lied to the God who had saved my life. Whilst you were
kissing my trembling lips, you were not aware that you were embracing
death!&rsquo; &lsquo;O heaven!&rsquo; cried the missionary; &lsquo;dear child, what have you
done?&rsquo; &lsquo;A crime, my father,&rsquo; said Atala, with her eyes wandering; &lsquo;but I
only destroyed myself, and I saved my mother.&rsquo; &lsquo;Finish then!&rsquo; I exclaimed,
full of fear. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I had foreseen my weakness; and on
quitting the cabins I took away with me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘What?&rsquo; I interrupted with horror. &lsquo;A poison?&rsquo; said the father. &lsquo;It is now
at my heart,&rsquo; cried Atala.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The torch slipped from the hermit&rsquo;s hand. I fell fainting near Lopez&rsquo;s
daughter. The old man took each of us in his arms, and during a short
interval we all three mingled our sobs on the funeral couch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us be stirring; let us be stirring,&rsquo; said the courageous father, as
he rose to light a lamp. &lsquo;We are losing precious moments: like intrepid
Christians, let us brave the assaults of adversity; with the cord about
our necks, and with ashes upon our heads, let us throw ourselves at the
feet of the Most High, to implore His clemency, and to submit ourselves to
His decrees. Perhaps it may still be time. My daughter, you ought to have
told me of this last night.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas! my father,&rsquo; said Atala, &lsquo;I looked for you last night; but heaven,
as a punishment for my faults, kept you away from me. Besides, all help
would have been useless; for even the Indians themselves, who are so
clever in what concerns poisons, know no remedy for that I have taken. O
Chactas, judge of my astonishment when I found that the result was not so
prompt as I had expected! My love redoubled my strength, and my soul was
unwilling to separate thus quickly from you!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was no longer by sobs that I now interrupted Atala&rsquo;s recital, but by a
torrent of passionate transports known only to savages. I rolled myself
upon the ground, twisting my arms and biting my hands. The old priest,
with wonderful tenderness, ran from brother to sister, endeavoring to
relieve us in a thousand ways. Through the calmness of his heartland from
the experience due to his weight of years, he knew how to act upon our
youth, and his religion furnished him with accents even more tender and
more ardent than our passions. Does not this priest, who had passed forty
years of daily sacrifice in the service of God and man upon the mountain,
remind you of the holocausts of Israel smoking perpetually on the high
places before the Lord?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Alas! it was in vain that he tried to procure a remedy for Atala&rsquo;s
sufferings. Fatigue, grief, poison, and a passion more mortal than all the
poisons together, had united to snatch the flower from the desert. Towards
evening terrible symptoms began to show themselves. A general numbness
took possession of Atala&rsquo;s limbs, and the extremities of her body became
cold. &lsquo;Touch my fingers,&rsquo; she said to me; &lsquo;do they not feel quite icy?&rsquo; I
could not reply. I was overcome with horror. Afterwards she added, &lsquo;Even
yesterday, my well-beloved, your contact made me quiver: and now I can no
longer feel your hand; I scarcely hear your voice, and the objects in the
grotto are disappearing from my sight one after the other. Are not the
birds singing? The sun must be nearly setting? Chactas, its rays will be
very beautiful in the desert, over my tomb!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Atala perceiving that her language had melted us into tears, said softly,
‘Pardon me, my kind friends; I am very weak, but perhaps I shall get
stronger. And yet to die so young, all at once, when my heart was so full
of life! Chief of prayer, take pity on me; support me. Do you think my
mother will be satisfied, and that God will forgive what I have done?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My daughter,&rsquo; replied the holy man, shedding tears, and wiping them away
with his trembling, mutilated fingers, &lsquo;all your misfortunes are the
result of your ignorance. Your savage education and the want of
instruction have been your ruin. You did not know that a Christian cannot
dispose of his life. Console yourself, therefore, my dear lamb; God will
pardon you, on account of the simplicity of your heart. Your mother, and
the imprudent missionary who guided her, are more to be blamed than you;
they exceeded their power in imposing an indiscreet vow upon you: but may
the Lord be with them! You all three offer a terrible example of the
dangers of enthusiasm, and of the want of enlightenment on religious
matters. Be of good cheer, my child; He who fathoms our thoughts and our
hearts will judge you according to your intentions, which were pure, and
not from your action, which was condemnable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;As for life, if the moment has come for you to sleep in the Lord, ah! my
child, you lose but little by losing this world! In spite of the solitude
in which you have lived, you have known sorrow; what would you have felt,
then, if you had witnessed the evils of society?&mdash;if, on visiting the
shores of Europe, your ear had been stricken by the long cry of suffering
heard throughout that old land? The dweller in the cabin, the inhabitant
of a palace, both suffer and groan here below: queens have been seen to
cry like simple women, and people have been astonished at the quantity of
tears shed by kings!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it your love that you regret? My daughter, you might as well weep
over a dream. Do you know the heart of man, and could you reckon upon the
inconstancies of his affection? Sacrifices and kindnesses, Atala, are not
eternal ties. One day, perhaps, disgust would have come with satiety, the
past would have been considered as nothing, and naught would have remained
but the inconveniences of a poor and despised union. Doubtless, my dear
daughter, the most beautiful loves were those of the man and woman who
issued from the hand of the Creator. A paradise had been prepared for
them. They were innocent and immortal. Perfect in soul and body, they
suited each other in every respect. Eve had been created for Adam, l and
Adam for Eve. If they, nevertheless, could not remain in that state of
happiness, what couple after them could do so? I will not speak to you of
the marriages of the first-born of men, of those ineffable unions between
sister and brother, in which love and friendship were confounded in the
same heart, and the purity of the one increased the delights of the other.
All those unions were troubled; jealousy crept over the altar of turf upon
which the goat was sacrificed, it existed beneath the tent of Abraham, and
even in the abodes of the patriarchs, where they experienced so much joy
that they forgot the death of their mothers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you suppose, then, my child, that you are more innocent and more
fortunate in your ties than those holy families from which Jesus Christ
deigned to descend? Again, woman renews her sufferings each time she
becomes a mother, and she weeps on her marriage-day. What grief there is
for her in the mere loss of her new-born babe, to whom she gave
nourishment, and who dies upon her bosom! The mountain was full of groans:
nothing could console Rachel for the loss of her sons. The bitterness
attendant upon human affections is so powerful that I have in my country
seen grand ladies, the beloved of kings, quit the life of a court to bury
themselves in a cloister, and mutilate that rebellious flesh, the
pleasures of which are only the precursors of sorrow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;But perhaps you would say that these last examples do not affect you;
that all your ambition was limited to the desire of living in an obscure
cabin with the man of your choice; that you sought less after the sweets
of marriage than after the charms of that folly which youth calls love?
Delusion, chimera, vanity&mdash;the dream of a diseased imagination! I
also, my daughter, have known the troubles of the heart. This head has not
been always bald, nor this breast always so calm as it appears to you
to-day. Believe in my experience: if man, constant in his affections,
could unceasingly respond to a sentiment constantly renewed, solitude and
love would doubtless render him the equal of God Himself; for those are
the two eternal pleasures of the Great Being. But the soul of man becomes
weary, and never loves the same object long and fully. There are always
some points upon which two hearts do not agree, and in the end those
points suffice to render life insupportable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Finally, my dear child, the great error of men, in their dream of
happiness, is that they forget the infirmity of death inseparable from
their nature; the end must come. Sooner or later, whatever might have been
your felicity, your beautiful visage would have been changed into that
uniform face which the sepulchre gives to the family of Adam. Even the eye
of Chactas would not have been able to distinguish you from amongst your
sisters of the tomb. Love does not extend its empire so far as the worms
in the coffin. What have I to say (O vanity of vanities!), what can I say
concerning the durability of earthly friendships? Would you, my dear
daughter, know its extent? If a man were to return to light some years
after his death, I do not believe he would be received with joy even by
those who had shed the most tears to his memory; so quickly are new ties
contracted, so easily fresh habits are indulged in, so entirely is
inconstancy natural to man, and so little is our life even in the hearts
of our friends!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank, therefore, the Divine goodness, my dear daughter, for taking you
away thus early from this valley of misery. Already the white robe and the
brilliant crown of virgins are being prepared for you in the skies;
already I hear the Queen of the Angels crying out to you, &ldquo;Come, my worthy
servant; come, my dove; come and sit down upon the throne of candor,
amidst all those maidens who have sacrificed their beauty and their youth
in the service of humanity, in the education of children, and in works of
penitence.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As the last ray of daylight stills the winds and spreads tranquillity
through the sky, so the old man&rsquo;s calm language appeased the passions in
the bosom of my lover. She no longer thought of anything but my grief, and
of the means for enabling me to support her loss. At first she said that
she should die happy if I would promise her to dry my tears; then she
spoke to me of my mother and of my country, and endeavored to distract me
from present grief by referring to past sufferings. She exhorted me to
patience and virtue. &lsquo;You will not always be unhappy,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;if
Heaven tries you to-day, it is merely to render you more compassionate for
the ills of others. The heart, Chactas, is like those trees that only
yield their balm for healing men&rsquo;s wounds after having been themselves
seared with iron.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When she had thus spoken, Atala turned towards the missionary, seeking
from him the consolation she had been endeavoring to impart to me; and, by
turns consoling and consoled, she gave and received the word of life; upon
the couch of death.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, the hermit redoubled his zeal. With the torch of religion
in his hand, he appeared to be guiding Atala to the tomb, to show her its
secret wonders. The humble grotto was full of the grandeur of this
Christian agony, and the heavenly spirits were no doubt attentive to the
scene, in which Religion had to struggle alone against Love, Youth and
Death.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Divine Religion triumphed, and her victory was perceptible from the holy
sadness that followed our hearts&rsquo; previous passionate transports. Towards
the middle of the night, Atala seemed to revive, and repeated the prayers
pronounced by the monk at the side of her couch. Shortly afterwards, she
offered me her hand, and, in a voice scarcely audible, said, &lsquo;Son of
Outalissi, do you remember the night when you took me for the Virgin of
the Last Loves? What a singular omen of our destiny! She stopped, then
continued: &lsquo;When I think that I am leaving you for ever, my heart makes
such an effort to live, that I feel almost strong enough to render myself
immortal by the power of my love. But, O God! Thy will be done!&rsquo; Atala
became silent during a few instants; then she added: &lsquo;It only remains for
me to ask your pardon for all the ills I have caused you. Chactas, a
little earth thrown upon my body will place a world between you and me,
and will deliver you forever from the weight of my calamities!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon you!&rsquo; I exclaimed, drowned in tears; &lsquo;Is it not I who have caused
all your misfortunes?&rsquo; &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; she replied, interrupting me, &lsquo;you
have rendered me very happy, and if I had to begin my life over again, I
should still prefer the happiness of having loved you for a few short
moments in an exile of adversity to an entire life of repose in my own
country.&rsquo;

&ldquo;Here Atala&rsquo;s voice languished: the shadows of death spread themselves
about her eyes and her mouth; her wandering fingers endeavored to catch at
something and she spoke lowly with the invisible spirits. Soon, however,
making an effort, she attempted, but in vain, to take the little crucifix
from her neck; she asked me to untie it myself, and then said to me:&mdash;

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When I spoke to you for the first time, by the light of the fire you saw
this cross shining upon my bosom; it is the only treasure that Atala
possesses. Lopez, your father and mine, sent it to my mother a few days
after my birth. Accept the inheritance, then, from me, my brother, and
keep it in remembrance of my misfortunes. Chactas, I have a last request
to make of you. Our union on earth, my friend, would have been short; but
after this life there is a longer life. I only go before you to-day, and I
will wait for you in the celestial empire. If you have loved me, get
yourself instructed in the Christian religion, which will prepare our
re-union. That religion has worked a great miracle under your own eyes,
since it enables me to quit you without the anguish of despair. Still,
Chactas, I only desire you to make me a simple promise. I know too well
what it costs to ask an oath from you. Perhaps such a vow might separate
you from some woman happier than I. O my mother, pardon thy daughter! I am
again succumbing to my weaknesses, and am turning aside from Thee, O my
God, thoughts that should be thine, and thine only!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Overwhelmed with grief, I promised Atala that I would one day embrace the
Christian religion. At this moment the hermit, rising with an inspired
air, and stretching his arms towards the roof of the grotto, exclaimed,
‘It is time&mdash;it is time to call God hither!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scarcely had he uttered those words, when a supernatural force
constrained me to fall upon my knees and to turn my head towards the foot
of Atala&rsquo;s couch. The priest opened a secret place that contained a golden
urn covered with a silk veil; he then knelt down and prayed fervently.
Suddenly the grotto appeared to be illuminated: songs of angels and the
vibrations of celestial harps were heard in the air; and when the hermit
drew the sacred vessel from the tabernacle, I thought I saw God Himself
issue forth from the side of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The priest opened the cup, took between his fingers a wafer white as
snow, and approached Atala as he pronounced some mysterious words. That
saint&rsquo;s eyes were upturned in ecstacy. All her sufferings appeared to be
suspended; her entire being concentrated itself upon her mouth; her lips
parted, and advanced with respect to seek the God concealed beneath the
mystic bread. The saintly old man afterwards soaked a piece of cotton in
the consecrated oil, and looked for a moment at the dying maiden; when all
of a sudden he uttered these imposing words, &lsquo;Go, Christian soul, go;
return to your Creator!&rsquo; Raising then my downcast head, I cried, looking
at the vessel that contained the holy oil, &lsquo;My father, will that remedy
restore Atala to life?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, my son,&rsquo; said the old man, falling into my
arms, &lsquo;to life eternal!&rsquo; Atala had just expired.
</p>
<p>
At this point Chactas was obliged, for the second time, to interrupt the
recital of his story. His tears flowed copiously, and the tremor of his
voice only permitted him to utter broken words. The blind sachem opened
his breast and drew forth Atala&rsquo;s crucifix. &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;dear
token of adversity! O René, O my son! You see it; but I can see it no
longer.
</p>
<p>
Tell me whether, after so many years, the gold of it is tarnished? Do you
see any traces of my tears upon it? Could you recognize the part which had
been touched by the lips of a saint? How is it that Chactas is not yet a
Christian? What trivial motives of policy or nationality have kept him in
the errors of his fathers? No; I will no longer delay. The earth is crying
out to me, &lsquo;When, then, wilt thou go down into the tomb, and for what art
thou waiting to embrace a Divine religion?&rsquo;.... Earth! thou shalt not wait
long, for as soon as a priest shall have regenerated by baptism this head
whitened with grief, I hope to be re-united to Atala.... But let me finish
what remains to be told of my story.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I will not undertake, René, to picture the despair that took possession
of my soul when Atala had heaved her last sigh. It would require more
warmth than I have left, and that my closed eyes might re-open to the sun,
to ask it to tell of the tears they shed in its light. Yes, the moon now
shining above our heads will become weary of lighting the solitudes of
Kentucky&mdash;the river that is now bearing our pirogues will suspend the
course of its waters&mdash;before my tears cease to flow for Atala! During
two days I was insensible to the hermit&rsquo;s conversation. In trying to calm
my grief, the excellent man did not employ the commonplace reasonings of
earthly minds. All he said was, &lsquo;My son, it is the will of God;&rsquo; and then
he pressed me in his arms. I should never have thought there was so much
consolation in those few words of a resigned Christian, if I had not
myself experienced it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The mild tenderness and the unvarying patience of the old servant of God
at length conquered the obstinacy of my grief; I became ashamed of the
tears I caused him to shed. &lsquo;My father,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;this is too much: let
the passions of a young man disturb the peace of your days no longer.
Permit me to carry away the remains of my spouse; I will inter them in
some corner of the desert; and if I am condemned to live on for a time, I
will endeavor to render myself worthy of the eternal nuptials that were
promised me by Atala.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At this unexpected return of courage, the good father trembled with joy,
saying, &lsquo;O blood of Jesus Christ, blood of my Divine Master, I acknowledge
herein Thy merits! Thou wilt no doubt save this young man. My God, finish
Thy work; restore peace to this troubled soul, and leave it but the humble
and useful remembrances of its misfortunes!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The righteous man refused to give up to me the body of Lopez&rsquo;s daughter;
but he proposed to call together his neophytes, and to inter it with all
the pomp of the Christian ceremonial. In my turn, I refused. &lsquo;Atala&rsquo;s
misfortunes and virtues,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;were unknown to men; let her grave, dug
secretly by our hands, share that obscurity.&rsquo; We agreed to set off the
next morning at sunrise, and to bury Atala beneath the arch of the natural
bridge at the entrance to the Groves of Death. It was also decided that we
should pass the night in prayer near the corpse of the saint.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Towards evening we transported the precious remains to an opening of the
grotto looking to the north. The hermit had enveloped them in a piece of
European lawn, woven by his mother. It was the only thing still remaining
to him of his country, and he had long preserved it for his own tomb. We
laid Atala upon a turf of mountain-sensitives; her feet, her head, her
shoulders, and a part of her bosom were uncovered. There was a faded
magnolia in her hair, the same flower I had placed upon the virgin&rsquo;s couch
to render her fruitful. Her lips, like a rose-bud gathered two mornings
before, seemed to languish and smile. Her cheeks, of sparkling whiteness,
showed a number of blue veins. Her beautiful eyes were closed, her modest
feet joined together, and her hands of alabaster pressed against her heart
an ebony crucifix; the scapulary of her vows was fastened about her neck.
She appeared as though enchanted by the angel of melancholy, and by the
double sleep of innocence and of the tomb.
</p>
<p>
I never saw anything so heavenly. By a person unconscious that this young
girl had enjoyed the light, she might have been taken for a statue of
Sleeping Virginity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The monk did not cease praying all night. I sat in silence at the end of
my Atala&rsquo;s funeral couch. How often, during her sleep, I had held that
charming head upon my knees! How many times I had leaned over her to hear
her breathe, and to inhale her breath! But at present no sound issued from
that motionless breast, and it was in vain that I looked for the awakening
of my love!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The moon lent her pale light to this funereal watching; she rose in the
middle of the night, like a white vestal come to weep over the coffin of a
companion. From time to time the monk dipped a flowering branch into the
holy water, and shaking its moistened leaves, perfumed the night air with
heavenly balms. Occasionally also he repeated, to an ancient tune, these
verses by an old poet named Job:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I have passed away like a flower; I have withered like the grass of the
fields.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the
bitter in soul?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thus sang the old man. His deep and irregular voice went rolling through
the silence of the desert. The name of God and of the tomb issued from all
the echoes, from all the torrents, and from all the forests, and the
Groves of Death seemed to be murmuring a distant chorus of the departed in
reply to the hermit&rsquo;s sacred chant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, a bar of gold was forming in the east. The sparrow-hawks
were crying upon the rocks, and the martins creeping back into the hollows
of the elm-trees: these were so many signs that the time had come for
Atala&rsquo;s interment. I took the body on my shoulders; the hermit walked in
front of me, carrying a spade in his hand. We commenced the descent from
rock to rock; old age and death combined equally to slacken our pace. At
the sight of the dog which had found us in the forest, and which now,
jumping with joy, led us by another route, I melted into tears. Atala&rsquo;s
long hair, the plaything of the morning breezes, frequently threw its
golden veil over my eyes, and, bending beneath the burden, I was obliged
to lay it down often upon the moss, and sit awhile, to recover my
strength. At length we arrived at the spot selected by my grief, and we
entered beneath the arch of the bridge. O my son, you should have seen the
youthful savage and the old hermit, on their knees in front of each other,
in the desert, digging with their hands a grave for the poor girl whose
body lay stretched out close at hand, in the dried-up bed of a torrent!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When our work was terminated, we transported the loved one into her bed
of clay. Taking then a little dust in my hand, and observing a fearful
silence, I looked upon Atala&rsquo;s face for the last time. I afterwards spread
the earth over that forehead of eighteen springs; gradually I saw the
features of my sister disappear, and her graces become hidden beneath the
curtain of eternity. &lsquo;Lopez!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;behold your son burying your
daughter!&rsquo; And I finished by covering Atala entirely with the earth of
sleep.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We returned to the grotto, where I made the missionary acquainted with
the project I had formed of remaining with him. The saint, who wonderfully
understood the heart of man, penetrated my thought and the artfulness of
my grief. He said: &lsquo;Chactas, son of Outalissi, so long as Atala was alive,
I myself desired that you should live with me; but at present your lot is
changed; you owe yourself to your country. Believe me, my son, such griefs
are not eternal. Sooner or later they wear themselves out, because the
heart of man is finite. That is one of our great miseries; we are not even
capable of being unhappy for a long time. Return to the Mississippi; go
and console your mother, who weeps for you day by day, and who stands in
need of your support. Get yourself instructed in Atala&rsquo;s religion,
whenever an opportunity presents itself; and remember that you promised
her to be virtuous and Christian. I will watch over her tomb. Go, my son;
God, your sister&rsquo;s soul, and the heart of your old friend, will follow
you!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such was the language of the man of the rock. His authority was too
great, his wisdom too profound, not to be obeyed. The next morning I
quitted my venerable host, who, pressing me to his heart, gave me his last
counsels, his last blessing, and his last tears. I went to the grave, and
was surprised at finding a little cross placed over the body, as one may
sometimes perceive the mast of a vessel that has been wrecked. I judged
that the hermit had been there to pray during the night. This mark of
friendship and religion caused me to shed an abundance of tears. I was
almost tempted to re-open the tomb, in order to gaze once more upon my
well-beloved; a religious fear withheld me. I sat down upon the
recently-disturbed ground. With an elbow resting upon my knees, and my
head supported by my hand, I remained buried for a time in a most bitter
reverie. O René! it was then that, for the first time, I made serious
reflections upon the vanity of our days, and the still greater vanity of
our projects. Ah! my child, who has not made such reflections? I am no
longer but an old stag whitened by the winters; my years compete with
those of the crow. Well, in spite of the number of days accumulated over
my head, in spite of such a long experience of life, I have not yet met
with a man who had not been deceived in his dreams of happiness, nor a
heart that did not contain a hidden wound.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Having thus seen the sun rise and set upon this place of grief, the next
day, at the first cry of the stork, I prepared to leave the sacred
sepulchre. I quitted it as the spot from which I desired to start upon a
career of virtue. Three times I evoked the soul of Atala; three times the
genius of the desert responded to my cries beneath the funeral arch. I
afterwards saluted the East, and then I perceived, amongst the mountain
paths in the distance, the friendly hermit going to the cabin of some
unhappy creature. Falling upon my knees, and ardently embracing Atala&rsquo;s
grave, I exclaimed, &lsquo;Sleep in peace in this foreign land, too unfortunate
maiden! In return for your love, for your exile, and for your death, you
are going to be abandoned, even by Chactas!&rsquo; Then, shedding a flood of
tears, I separated from Lopez&rsquo;s daughter, and, tearing myself from the
spot, left at the foot of nature&rsquo;s monument a monument still more august&mdash;the
humble Tomb of Virtue.&rdquo;

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hactas, son of Outalissi the Natchez, related this story to René the
European. Fathers have repeated it to their sons; and I, a traveller to
distant lands, have faithfully narrated what the Indians told me. I saw in
this story the picture of the hunting people and of the laboring people;
religion, the first lawgiver of men; the dangers of ignorance and
religious enthusiasm opposed to the light, the charity and the veritable
spirit of the Evangile; the struggles of the passions and the virtues in a
simple heart; and, finally, the triumph of Christianity over the most
ardent sentiment and the most terrible fear&mdash;Love and Death.
</p>
<p>
When a Seminole related this story to me, I found it very instructive and
perfectly beautiful, because he narrated it with the flowery eloquence of
the desert, the grace of the cabin, and a simplicity in describing grief
which I am afraid I have not been able to preserve. But one thing remained
for me to learn. I wished to know what had become of Father Aubry, and no
one could tell me. I should never have ascertained if Providence, who
guides all, had not led me to discover what I was seeking. This is how the
matter came about.
</p>
<p>
I had visited the shores of the Mississippi, which formerly constituted
the southern boundary of New France, and I was desirous of seeing, in the
north, that other wonder of the American empire, the cataract of Niagara.
I had nearly reached the falls, in the ancient country of the
Agannonsioni, * when one morning, as I was crossing a plain, I perceived a
woman seated beneath a tree, and holding a dead child upon her knees. I
quietly approached the young mother, and heard her singing to this effect:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If thou hadst remained amongst us, dear babe, with what grace thy hand
might have bent the bow! Thy arm might have tamed the furious bear, and
thy steps might have outrun the flying kid on the summit of the mountain.
White ermine of the rock, to go so young to the land of souls! How wilt
thou manage to live there? Thy father is not there to feed thee with the
produce of his chase. Thou wilt be cold, and no Spirit will give thee
skins to cover thyself. Oh! I must hasten to rejoin thee, to sing songs to
thee and to give thee my breast.&rdquo; And the young mother sang with a
trembling voice, rocked the child upon her knees, wetted its lips with her
maternal milk, and bestowed upon the dead all those cares which are
usually given to the living.
</p>
<p>
According to the Indian custom, the woman desired to dry the body of her
son upon the branches of a tree before taking it away to the tomb of its
ancestors. She therefore undressed the new-born babe, and, after breathing
some instants upon its mouth, uncovered its breast, and embraced the icy
remains, which would certainly have been re-animated by the fire of that
maternal heart, if God had not reserved to Himself the breath that imparts
life.
</p>
<p>
She rose, and looked about for a tree upon which she might lay her child.
She selected a maple with red flowers, festooned with garlands of apios,
that emitted the sweetest perfumes. With one hand she pulled down the
lowest branch, and with the other she placed the body thereon; then
loosing the branch, it returned to its natural position, with the remains
of innocence concealed in its ordoriforous foliage. Oh, how touching is
this Indian custom! Pompous monuments of the Crassi and of the Cæsars, I
have seen you in your desolated plains; but I by far prefer those aërian
tombs of the savages, those mausoleums of flowers and verdure, perfumed by
the bee and waved by the zephyr, wherein the nightingale builds its nest
and warbles its plaintive melody. When the mortal remains are those of a
young maiden suspended by the hand of a lover to the tree of death, or of
a beloved child placed by a fond mother in the dwelling of the little
birds, the charm is still greater. I approached her who was groaning at
the foot of the maple-tree, and placed my hands upon her head as I uttered
the three cries of grief. Afterwards, without speaking to the young
mother, I imitated her by taking a bough and driving away the insects that
were buzzing about the child&rsquo;s body. But I was careful not to disturb a
neighboring dove. The Indian woman said to it: &ldquo;Dove, if thou art not the
soul of my departed son, thou art doubtless a mother seeking for something
to make a nest. Take these hairs, which I shall no more wash in scented
water; take them for a bed for thy little ones, and may the Great Spirit
preserve them to thee!&rdquo;
 </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The Iroquois,
</pre>
<p>
Nevertheless, the mother wept with joy on remarking the stranger&rsquo;s
politeness. As we were thus occupied, a young man came up and said,
&ldquo;Daughter of Céluta, take down our child: we will no longer sojourn in
this place; we will set off at the rising of the next sun.&rdquo; I then said,
&ldquo;Brother, I wish you a blue sky, plenty of game, a beaver cloak, and hope!
You are not of the desert, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;we are exiles, and we are going to seek a
country.&rdquo; Saying that, the warrior lowered his head upon his breast, and
began knocking off the heads of some flowers with the end of his bow. I
saw that there were tears at the bottom of this story, so I remained
silent. The mother took her son&rsquo;s body down from the branch of the tree,
and gave it to her spouse to carry. I then said, &ldquo;Will you allow me to
light your fire to-night?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have no cottage,&rdquo; replied the warrior; &ldquo;but if you desire to follow
us, we are going to camp on the border of the Falls.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; I replied; and we started off together.
</p>
<p>
We soon arrived at the border of the cataract, which announced itself with
frightful roarings. It is formed by the river Niagara, which takes its
rise in Lake Erie, and falls into Lake Ontario. Its perpendicular height
is one hundred and forty-four feet. From Lake Erie to the Falls, the river
flows with a rapid inclination; and at the leap it is less a river than a
sea whose torrents crush each other in the yawning mouth of an abyss. The
cataract is divided into two branches, and bends like a horse-shoe.
Between the two falls there is an island, hollow underneath, and which
hangs with all its trees over the chaos of the waves. The mass of the
river which rushes towards the north, assumes the form of a vast cylinder,
unrolling itself into a field of snow, and shining with every color in the
sun; that which flows to the east descends into a fearful shade, and might
be taken for a column of the water of the Deluge. A thousand rainbows bend
and cross each other above the abyss. Striking against the shaken rock,
the water rebounds in whirlwinds of froth that rise above the forests like
smoke from a vast burning mass. Pine-trees, walnut-trees, and rocks worn
into fantastic forms, ornament the scene. Eagles, carried along by the
current of air, are whirled down to the bottom of the gulf; and carcajous,
hanging by their flexible tails to the ends of the fallen branches, wait
to seize in the abyss the crushed bodies of bears and elks.

<p>
Whilst I was contemplating this spectacle with a sort of pleasure mixed
with terror, the Indian and his spouse left me. I looked for them as I
ascended the river-side above the Falls, and soon discovered them in a
place suited to their grief. They were lying down upon the grass, with a
number of old men, near some human bones wrapped in bear-skins. Astonished
at everything I had seen during the last few hours, I sat down near the
young mother, and said, &ldquo;What is all this, my sister?&rdquo; She replied: &ldquo;My
brother, the earth of our country and the ashes of our forefathers follow
us in our exile.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;have you been reduced to such a misfortune?&rdquo; The
daughter of Céluta responded, &ldquo;We are the remains of the Natchez. After
the massacre of our nation by the French, to avenge their compatriots,
those of our brothers who escaped from the conquerors found refuge with
our neighbors, the Chikassas. We remained tranquilly with them for some
time; but seven moons ago, the white men from Virginia took possession of
our fields, affirming that they had been given to them by a king of
Europe. So we raised our eyes to heaven, and, laden with the remains of
our forefathers, started on our way across the desert. I was confined
during the march, and as my milk was bad on account of my grief, it caused
my child to die.&rdquo; As she spoke, the mother wiped her eyes with her hair. I
wept also.
</p>
<p>
After a while I said, &ldquo;My sister, let us adore the Great Spirit;
everything happens by His command. We are all travellers; our fathers were
the same; but there is a place where we shall find rest. If I were not
afraid of my tongue being as indiscreet as that of a white man, I would
ask of you if you have heard speak of Chactas the Natchez.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At these words the Indian woman looked at me, and asked, &lsquo;&rsquo;Who has spoken
to you of Chactas the Natchez? &ldquo;I replied, &ldquo;Wisdom.&rdquo; The Indian rejoined,
&ldquo;I will tell you what I know, because you drove away the flies from the
body of my son, and uttered good words concerning the Great Spirit. I am
the daughter of the daughter of René, the European whom Chactas had
adopted. Chactas, who had received baptism, and René, my unfortunate
grandfather, perished in the massacre.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Man passes constantly from grief to grief,&rdquo; I replied, bending myself
with humility. &ldquo;You might also perhaps be able to give me news of Father
Aubry?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was not more fortunate than Chactas,&rdquo; said the Indian. &ldquo;The Cherokees,
who were hostile to the French, attacked his Mission. They were guided
thither by the sound of a bell that was rung to succor travellers. Father
Aubry could have escaped, but he would not abandon his children, and
remained to encourage them to die by his example. He was burnt with great
torture; but his enemies could not draw from him a single cry that might
be turned to the shame of his God or to the dishonor of his country.
During the punishment he never ceased to pray for his executioners, and to
pity the lot of his fellow-victims. In order to compel him to betray a
mark of weakness, the Cherokees led to his feet a Christian savage, whom
they had horribly mutilated. But they were much surprised when they saw
the young man go down upon his knees and kiss the wounds of the old
hermit, who cried out to him, &lsquo;My child, we have been given as a spectacle
to men and to the angels.&rsquo; The Indians, furious at his expression, forced
a red-hot iron down his throat to prevent him from speaking; and
thereupon, no longer able to console his fellow-creatures, he expired.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is said that the Cherokees, accustomed though they were to see savages
suffer with indifference, could not refrain from confessing that there was
in Father Aubry&rsquo;s courage something unknown to them, and which surpassed
every description of courage they had witnessed. Several of them, struck
by his remarkable death, afterwards became Christians.

&ldquo;On his return to the land of white men, several years later, Chactas,
having heard of the misfortunes of the chief of prayer, went to gather the
Father&rsquo;s ashes, and those of Atala. He arrived at the spot where the
mission had formerly existed, but he could scarcely recognize it. The lake
was overflown, and the savannah changed into a marsh; the natural bridge,
which had fallen in, had buried Atala&rsquo;s tomb and the Groves of Death
beneath its ruins. Chactas wandered about the place for a length of time:
he visited the hermit&rsquo;s grotto, which he found full of weeds and
raspberry-trees, and occupied by a fawn giving suck to her kid. He sat
down upon the rock beneath which he had watched his dying Atala; but there
was nothing on it beyond a few feathers fallen from the wings of some
birds of passage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;While he was weeping, the missionary&rsquo;s tamed serpent issued from the
neighboring bushes, and came creeping to his feet. Chactas warmed in his
bosom the faithful friend who had remained alone in the midst of the
ruins. The son of Outalissi stated that several times, at the approach of
night, he fancied he saw the shades of Atala and Father Aubry rise out of
the misty twilight. These visions filled him with religious fear and a
joyful sadness.

&ldquo;After having sought the tomb of his sister and of the hermit in vain, he
was on the point of abandoning the spot, when the fawn from the grotto set
to leaping in front of him. She stopped at the foot of the Mission cross.
That cross was then half surrounded by water; the wood of it was covered
with moss, and the pelican of the wilderness loved to perch upon its
worm-eaten arms. Chactas judged that the graceful fawn had led him to the
tomb of his host.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He dug below the rock that had formerly served as an altar, and there
found the remains of a man and woman. He had no doubt but they were those
of the priest and of the virgin, buried, perhaps, by the angels in that
place; so he wrapped them in bear-skins, and started on his way back to
his country, carrying off the precious remains, which sounded on his
shoulders like the quiver of death. At night he placed them under his
pillow, and had dreams of love and of virtue. O stranger! you may here
contemplate that dust, and also the remains of Chactas himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As the Indian finished speaking, I rose, went towards the sacred ashes,
and prostrated myself before them in silence. I afterwards walked away
slowly, and with long strides, saying to myself, &ldquo;Thus ends upon earth all
that is good, virtuous and feeling! Man, thou art but a rapid and painful
dream! Thou only existest by misfortune; and if thou art anything at all,
it is merely by the sadness of thy soul and the eternal melancholy of thy
thoughts!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was preoccupied with such reflections all night. The next morning, at
day-break, my hosts left me. The young warriors opened the march, and
their wives closed it. The former were charged with the holy relics, the
latter carried their infants. The old men walked slowly in the middle&mdash;placed
between their forefathers and their posterity, between remembrance and
hope, between the lost country and the country to be found.
</p>
<p>
O what tears are shed when we thus abandon our native land!&mdash;when,
from the summit of the mountain of exile, we look for the last time upon
the roof beneath which we were bred, and see the hut-stream still flowing
sadly through the solitary fields surrounding our birth-place!
</p>
<p>
Unfortunate Indians!&mdash;you whom I have seen wandering in the deserts
of the New World with the ashes of your ancestors;&mdash;you who gave me
hospitality in spite of your misery&mdash;I could not now return your
generosity, for I am wandering, like you, at the mercy of men; but less
fortunate than you in my exile, I have not brought with me the bones of my
fathers.
